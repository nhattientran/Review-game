In A Nutshell

üîµ Pros
+ An incredible remake. Everything was remade from scratch using RE7's engine, delivering top-notch graphics quality.
+ Two parallel stories to play: Claire's and Leon's.
+ Plenty of hidden items, weapons and secrets to find, with exploration rewarding attentive and careful players.
+ True old-school survival horror experience: players need to be extremely conservative with resources and avoid combat when possible.
+ Varied, challenging gameplay situations that keep the experience fresh from start to end.
+ Higher difficulties provide considerable challenge even to veterans of the genre.

üî¥
- The ""Ink"" mechanic (enabling game saving only with a certain consumable) on Hardcore difficulty should be optional, as not all players might like it, but still would like the additional challenge compared to Normal.

===

First of all, it has to be said that this is a Remake with capital R, as everything was remade from scratch: models, textures, lighting, even the engine was completely changed to the excellent one used for RE7. As far as looks goes, RE2 delivers astonishing graphical detail, giving a true 2019-worthy look to this great game of old.

For those not knowing it, RE2 is an old-school survival horror, quite a bit different from the more recent chapters. Impersonating either Leon or Claire, players will have to carve their way through zombie infested police stations, putrid sewers, and even worse places. What really changes is how they do this, as RE2 is a ""pure"" survival horror game, favoring extreme conservation of resources for when they truly matter (boss fights, or unavoidable normal fights), while encouraging players to be creative and avoid as many unnecessary fights as possible, as one would do in a real apocalypse after all.

Exploration is rewarding and satisfying for the attentive players that do want to explore every corner, open every locker, crack every safe, lock they find, and examine items they find to reveal secrets. Not only this is rewarded with ever-needed resources, but aswell weapons and objects, such as additional inventory space, or weapon upgrades. And believe me when i say until the last bullet will be needed to make it through this horror, so better start looking! Combat features detailed dismemberment mechanics such as mutilating an enemy's legs to slow it down, or hitting weak points to stagger it momentarily and run past.






üéÆ
Gameplay in RE2 is divided into Exploration, Management and Combat.

Exploration is performed with a 3rd person visual, featuring mouse-based aiming, sprint/walk, and plenty of interactions with the environment such as using specific tools to open pathways, barricade windows, or opening lockers and containers to gather loot. Attention to detail and backtracking are fundamental in this game, as many areas will be only accessible as more and more tools and keys are gathered, so going back to already explored places is actually meaningful even if optional, as it often leads to great rewards for those willing to risk it.

Management is a fundamental mechanic in any survival horror, but especially in RE2. Inventory space, especially at the beginning without expansions, is very limited, so either going back often to the Stash to store items, or a wise optimization of resources are needed at all times. Combining herbs, ammo stacks, and decide what to take or leave behind are things players will do often in this title. With the presence of a global stash, however, it's just a matter of storing surplus into it often, when accessible. However, balancing the loadout in ammo, healing items and weapons is important and doing it wrong can lead to not having enough space for critical items.

üìñ
The story in RE2 is divided into two parallel campaigns, and its lore is narrated via pieces of information found scattered around, cut-scenes, and dialogues with various characters. The narrative is solid, decently written, and engaging from start to end. Characters have all strong, defined personalities and are interesting aswell. For not being the strong side of these titles, definitely good.

üëä
Combat in RE2 is tactical, pretty much slow-paced, and based upon accuracy, preparation, and knowing each enemy's skills and weaknesses. The best offense in this game is... to avoid combat. That's right: try to kill every enemy and soon all ammo will run out, leaving players defenseless and doomed in case of mandatory fights. Instead, careful planning of routes, engagements is vital to save up the spare resources for when they truly matter.

Still, then it comes to it, each weapon has good and diverse feeling to it, while enemies react beautifully to shots, in a shower of gore most of the time. Enemies are considerably tougher than most of nowadays games of the same genres, so beware. This might seem as a CON at first... but once understanding the game's concept, it becomes a good side of it.


üí∞
Priced at 60‚Ç¨, and lasting (depends on play-style, difficulty and experience GREATLY) around 10-16 hours, this is one of the VERY FEW titles i can recommend getting at FULL PRICE. The quality it delivers is simply too good to be missed.

üîó
This is not an easy game by any means, and players can even be forced to restart because of having wasted too many resources. But once understood, it delivers amazing satisfactions. Challenge level is medium/high.




üé•
Astonishing. RE7's engine, improved even more, with a plethora of modern effects, filters and settings to tweak, and top-quality textures, models, animations and effects, makes for one gorgeous title. Possibly one of the games with the best graphics around, considering it's a remake.

üîä
Excellent ambient sounds, effects, and voice-acting. Directional sounds, also featuring binaural audio for better realism, deliver excellent quality that contributes immensely to immersion.

üî©
The game runs without issues in 1440p with maxed out settings, 3GB textures and 120% quality, on the following config: [i7 4820K, GTX1080, 16GB RAM]. No performance or optimization problems to note.

üíª
Enemy AI is not that brilliant considering most enemies are mutants or zombies. As expected. The few ""intelligent"" enemies follow patterns of movement through the maps and chase players on sight.

üè†
Good interface and menu handling, without any issue for the genre.

üêõ
Nothing major to report. Great polishing and refinement.

This game has me emotional in a way I can‚Äôt explain. I‚Äôve loved the Resident Evil series with a fiery passion ever since I played my very first entry with Code Veronica X on the PS2. After I finished playing the hell out of that game, I devoured every Resident Evil title I could get my hands on and was a dedicated fan (even wrote my share of fan fiction) all the way up until Resident Evil 6, which thoroughly ripped my heart to shreds with what the series had become. While RE7 was something of a return to form despite the first person perspective, it was missing the one thing I loved so much about these games; the characters. I didn't realize until now how badly I missed my time with them, but stepping into Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield‚Äôs shoes again felt like coming home.

CLAIRE!!! 
A Screenshot of Resident Evil 2
By: Chudah‚Ñ¢

That said, I was terrified that like so many overly-hyped, high profile titles these days, that Resident Evil 2 would stumble and miss the mark. But let me tell you, they nailed it. THEY NAILED IT! Granted, the story has been somewhat simplified, and the B scenarios feel rushed and a bit tacked on (likely a result of the devs not wanting to disappoint the fans when word leaked that they wouldn‚Äôt be included), but those are miniscule grievances when the rest of the game is so supremely satisfying. Everything that I loved about the series is back, and it all looks, sounds and feels so good that I‚Äôm literally getting choked up right now just typing this.

Even the swap to over-the-shoulder camera feels fitting and natural, and I‚Äôve long been a champion of fixed camera angles. But the way the action is framed, the long, dark, endless corridors, the creatures that lurk in the shadows, the terrifying sounds they make, it all makes up for the loss. Fortunately, the characters don‚Äôt move with quite as much agility as they do in post-RE4 titles either. There‚Äôs no dodge button, no quick time events, no counterattacks. If you‚Äôre grabbed by a zombie, you either shove a grenade down its throat or suffer the consequences. This heightens the suspense tremendously. No matter how heinous the foe, you need to tread carefully, and wisely.


And that's not even mentioning how much better the writing and acting is. The dialogue actually sounds somewhat believable, albeit cliche at times, and the interactions between characters are so much more organic than they used to be (thank goodness there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù moment‚Ä¶) All of this is elevated by the voice actors giving great performances which really help bring these characters to life. We already know who bad-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• super agent Leon S. Kennedy is, but it‚Äôs refreshing watching the rookie cop become the man we all know and love.

I honestly could continue gushing about the game for several more paragraphs, but there‚Äôs already thousands of reviews that‚Äôll say the exact same thing. So I‚Äôll just say this; if you‚Äôre an old school Resident Evil fan and you can get past the modernization of a classic, then you need to play this game. YOU NEED IT! This is old school survival horror in a gorgeous new wrapping, and every bit as good as the original.",Recommended," February 1, 2019"

Resident Evil 2: Remake is a fun and tension filled homage to classic Resident Evil games with an excellent modern twist.

Speaking from a guy who has only played Resident Evil 4 and 5 and never experienced the true survival horror capabilities the Resident Evil franchise has to offer i‚Äôd say the game is perfect for anybody curious about diving into the series as well as being satisfying for long time fans.

+Pros

+Gameplay
Instead of the fixed camera angles the first RE2 had this version is updated into a 3rd person perspective allowing for a more organic and natural feel for gameplay. Despite the perspective changes you‚Äôll often find the game to still be quite claustrophobic as many zombies will try and snuggle up with you while in a small corridor so no worries there.

Shooting is the same in this game as the other Resident Evil titles so make sure to position yourself carefully and aim for the head so you suddenly don‚Äôt find yourself with a chunk of your flesh missing.

The game also allows you to be a little creative when dealing with zombies. So say you want to shoot them but don‚Äôt want to use too much ammo, you can also shoot them in the legs and disable them so it‚Äôs easier to run away and trust me it‚Äôs quite fun to do.

Still though, running away is still the most optimal way to play the game as ammo and healing items are worth their weight in gold, especially on hardcore difficulty, and it‚Äôs best not to waste them by fighting every zombie you come across.

You‚Äôll also find various puzzles you‚Äôll need to solve in order to progress through the game. The best addition to this game is that whenever you fully explore a room, the room will then be colored blue telling you that all possible items have been retrieved so if you ever want to find out where to probably check out next just check your map and you‚Äôre on your way.

All in all, the gameplay is fantastic and definitely can keep you on edge throughout your entire playtime.

This game is absolutely meant to be experienced with headphones as it really adds to the horror factor hearing the zombies constantly banging their hands on windows and doors trying to break into the police station and it also helps gameplay wise when a zombie you thought was dead suddenly starts snarling back to life.


The game looks absolutely gorgeous as you‚Äôll soon find out that with every bullet you put inside a zombies dome the blood and character models on the zombies look both beautiful and terrifying at the same time.

The lighting is also top notch as most of the areas you‚Äôll explore are very dark and you‚Äôll make use of a flashlight in order to navigate and it can be seen that a lot of effort has been made to make sure it looks both good and is functional for gameplay.

Facial animations during cutscenes and the environment you‚Äôll explore is also well polished and pleasing to the eyes.

Just by examining a general overview of the entire story so far and all the lore the Resident Evil series has established so far it can be seen as a little convoluted and ridiculous even for people who are long time fans of the series.

However, seeing as how the story has just relatively begun, the story is more simplistic and easier to follow as well as a few changes being made in this game to streamline the action.


As you do get to play as both Claire and Leon in the game it can lead to a few slight problems with the continuity in the story.

For example, who got into the police station first? Who met Sherry first? Are there multiple Mr. X‚Äôs?

Small stuff like that that continues to make the timeline a bit skewed here and there.

The actual game itself is very short as it would only take me about 13 hours to fully complete both Leon A and Claire B and that includes running around getting all of the collectibles. If you play on hardcore difficulty it may take you a bit longer but for a standard playthough you should be able to beat the game relatively quickly.

Now while there is replay value in playing throughout all the different routes if you‚Äôre a one time playthrough kind of person, you may lose some value in this game.

Resident Evil 2: Remake works both as a fun action/zombie game and tension filled, survival horror as you‚Äôll constantly be on your toes as zombies will barge through doors and windows to get a taste of your delicious meaty flesh. Story is also easy enough to understand so anybody can dive right in without any prior knowledge as to who these people are and how they stand in the franchise.


All in all, if you‚Äôre like me and just want to find out what all the fuss was about it‚Äôs definitely worth a pick up at full price and for long time fans you‚Äôll feel right at home",Recommended," November 27, 2019"

To me, one of the trickiest balances in game design is the split between fun and challenge. It‚Äôs fun to be challenged, but too much challenge can take a serious bite out of the fun. Stressful games like Dark Souls and Darkest Dungeon have found success by finding players that will accept them on their own unique terms, but that‚Äôs not the only way to bridge the gap. I know that now because of Resident Evil 2, a game that can be stressful, terrifying, and incredibly fun all at once. Honestly I didn‚Äôt even think it was possible to thread that needle so effectively, but RE2 has the magic touch that can push you to your breaking point and make you love every second of it.

Something has gone terribly, terribly wrong in Raccoon City. A vicious, unstoppable virus has torn through the town, leaving the residents either dead or undying. It‚Äôs a hell of a first day on the force for rookie cop Leon Kennedy, and a huge complication in Claire Redfield‚Äôs search for her brother. Their paths will cross several times in this chaos, as they search for both answers and escape. The architects of this disaster are still at large, and may be closer than either Leon or Claire would think, along with some shadowy figures who have their own interests here. But there‚Äôs a ruined city, a litany of puzzling obstacles, and countless zombies between them and their goal, and it‚Äôs going to take a little luck and whole lot of nerve to get through.

For the record, I never played the original Resident Evil 2, and I haven‚Äôt even played any versions of the first game in the series. I‚Äôm jumping into this with only some basic cultural literacy here, but RE2 is perfectly accommodating to newcomers. The plot is perfectly simple at its core: zombies everywhere, don‚Äôt die. I understand there are plenty of references to other games in the details, but you definitely don‚Äôt need to study the wiki to shoot zombies and collect crests. Indeed, the quality of the game‚Äôs cutscenes and voice acting is so incredibly high that you‚Äôll surely find yourself engrossed in the unfolding drama regardless of your background knowledge. The presentation here does a ton to sell the experience of a zombie apocalypse, and heighten the tension or humanize situations when most effective.

The real star of the show, though, is the action. Following an intense intro that wastes exactly no time getting to the good stuff, you‚Äôll find yourself in a vast police station that‚Äôs all kinds of falling apart. Zombies are breaking in the windows, crawling out of the vents, and laying in wait for their next meal. As Leon or Claire, you‚Äôve only got what you can find to deal with them, which includes a very modest amount of weapons, ammunition, tools, and medicine. Your foes in this game are not the mindless hordes you might be accustomed to from other zombie titles, as they can take bullet after bullet to the head without breaking their pace. Every single undead is an existential threat to you, with the potential to take your health from full to zero if you don‚Äôt take them seriously. You won‚Äôt have the resources to dispatch every single zombie, either, so resource management is absolutely essential.

And this all goes double for the more exotic foes you‚Äôll face as you descend deeper into the mystery! The result is a game that‚Äôs intensely stressful every single time you depart from a safe room, that can terrify you simply by putting a common enemy in an uncommon place and letting them do what they do. Your life is threatened here in a way most horror games don‚Äôt have the gumption to do, because not only can the monsters kill you, defeating the monsters badly can kill you. Being far away from your save point or stash of items with no bullets or no healing items is terrifying unlike any jump scare or chase scene, and perfectly evokes the true horror of zombie media, that of inevitable doom. That feeling only gets stronger when the game reveals more of its threats, one of which has become iconic in how it heralds your absolute downfall.

Resident Evil 2 is chock full of sequences you don‚Äôt want to go through. You‚Äôll see things through windows or on your map that you know will be total nightmares to endure. And you‚Äôll do it, because the experience is so rewarding. The tight over-the-shoulder controls and aiming give you all the tools you need to use every bullet effectively and dodge past foes. Weapon impacts are forceful and meaty, and if you‚Äôre any sort of gorehound then you‚Äôll be treated to some top-tier blood and viscera as the bullets fly. Seriously, I have never seen a game that modeled bullet impacts on heads so effectively, and if it wasn‚Äôt happening to zombies I‚Äôm not sure I could handle it. But getting that lucky shot that splits an undead‚Äôs head like a watermelon is all the more gratifying for the absurd explosion of flesh that announces it.

Really, this is about as close as you can get to the perfect zombie survival game, if slow zombies, thin resources, and risky combat are what you‚Äôre looking for. And there‚Äôs tons of it to experience, too, with the A and B routes for both characters that reveal different bits of the story and offer different challenges. There are additional modes as well, and a fair number of unexpected twists and secrets along the way, all of which should last you dozens of hours to uncover. The only reason you‚Äôd punch out early from this one is to give yourself a breather, though, because it‚Äôs an absolute master class in turning stress and challenge into pure fun.

Far less flamboyant than the later entries, RE2 takes us back to those simple days when Leon wasn't an unstoppable somersaulting action hero, and merely a few zombie bites could put him down for the count. This is true survival horror (not that I have a problem with action RE; actually, I friggin' love it). Movement is slow and cumbersome. Ammo is limited. Even knives -- I primarily used mine to fillet downed zombos and save shells -- break readily, and unless you play it close, it's easy to be left with nothing. The creatures in this game are complete bullet sponges, so stay calm and watch your aim! It's no mean feat to center your reticle on the noggin of a shuffling undead when he's swinging it around like Will Smith in the Fresh Prince of Bel Air opening.

What you've probably heard most about is Mr. X: an unkillable, wrinkly terminator guy in a cute detective hat who pursues you, slow-stridin' Jason Vorhees-style, through select portions of the game. If you've played Haunting Ground or Clocktower 3, it's nothing quite so elaborate; you can't hide behind credenzas or distract him with fine chocolates, only run away (and smack-dab into the claws of a licker), and if he catches you, he simply karate punches you into the afterlife with his big meaty fist. It's that stressful kind of fun that opens up your adrenal glands and makes you scream ""I hate it! I hate it!"" like a small, spoiled child. But you love it, really, because it makes you feel inside, and that's what these games are all about. Watching your brother/friend play is just as engrossing as playing yourself.

If you're an RE fan, make sure to go through both segments. They're pretty similar, but each has its own supporting characters, one radically different side-story in the middle, and a unique final boss. If for some reason you can only play , pick Claire's. It's got the most meat.

Speaking of meat, the opening shot in this game? It's a super close-up of the most disgusting, detailed, squishiest, greasiest fast food burger I've seen in a video game. That's got to be a first!",Recommended, March 27

This game elevates the Resident Evil series to the same level of quality as the Metal Gear Series. I mean I‚Äôve loved Resident Evil since Playstation One but the series has been a mixed bag in terms of quality design.

Resident Evil 2 Remake is on a genius level though and it‚Äôs easily the best made game in the whole series. Other high points in the series include well known, high quality games such as Resident Evil 4.

However this game is on a whole other level of expert design and quality decision making. The dedication to honouring the original is admirable while managing to also push the series forward to new levels of greatness.

The first 3 Resident Evil games on the PS1 were so cool back in the 90‚Äôs, when I was a kid. The quality horror mixed with the silliness of the dialogue and characters were great.

Then Resident Evil 4 came along and knocked it out of the park again by innovating while maintaining the entertaining, silly tone of the series. After that we had some dodgy games thrown in which varied from okay to absolute crap.

By combining what was great from the past with an incredible new design, this game is the best one in the series. I want to see the same team remake Resident Evil 1 and 3 with the exact same level of dedication and quality design.

Resident Evil 2 Remake is a major success for this series and for video games in general. I highly recommend that everybody show their support for the developers and buy this game.

It is fantastic!",Recommended," February 7, 2019"

I've watched a lot of horror movies throughout my life. Most of them alone during the dark. I've always been scared throughout every movie, but after I finish them, I feel silly for being scared...

I've also played a lot of horror games. Some during the day. The ones that comes to mind as being most scary is probably dead space and one of the older doom games. To be honest, both those games had scary moments in them, but even so, I found myself enjoying them more than being scared.

The most scary thing I do, is probably listen to true crime podcasts, while walking my dog through a forest nearby my home during dark. I always end up watching my back, and take the same short path out of the forest quickly after entering it.

Finally, before actually reviewing the game - I'm an engineer, atheist, husband and a dad - so no, I don't believe in any mumbo jumbo, and I'm the one who gets up during the night when my family hears a noise. So, to say the least - I don't scare easily and I never have.

This game...

Let me put it this way. My heart rate went through the roof, from start to finish. I never relaxed, not a second. So, I had to stop playing and come back to it several times, in order not to suffer a heart seizure. Around 2 hours into the game, I wanted it to be over. Because I wasn't enjoying it. I never did! How could I? I was freaking frightened out of my mind every single second! It was pure torture!!! And I kept wondering, why I put myself through this the whole time.

I tell you why. Because RE2 is like the scariest roller coaster you‚Äôll find. It's something you need to experience, even though you'll regret it during the entire ride. Because once it's over, you can be proud that you didn‚Äôt cower away from the challenge! I guess to complete the picture, the roller coaster lasts for several hours, and once you think you completed it ‚Äì there is a ‚Äúsecond‚Äù ride... (you get to play the story all over again, but with a different take). Hell NO!

My ratings of this game ‚Äì 10/10. CAPCOM really went above and beyond. It‚Äôs so obvious that no shortcuts were taken, no corners were cut. This game was made with great care, and it shows, as every aspect is incredibly well polished. If I have to point to anything negative it‚Äôs probably that I won‚Äôt be able to resist the next RE game that CAPCOM releases... and trust me, I HATE THEM FOR IT!",Recommended," May 30, 2019"

Let me keep it short: The Resi 2 remake has rekindled my faith in video games.

I've been playing since the early 80s and lately my love for the medium had gotten kind of stale. Then along came this one: A righteous, thrilling, old-school, no-nonsense, rock 'em, sock 'em adventure. It's super-gory, it's challenging, it's hardcore. There's no irony, no tongue-in-cheek fan-service, no memes, no bullcrap. After completing this game, you'll feel as though you'd had a dark, horrifying yet incredibly exciting dream. This is what video games are all about.

Survival Horror is back!

This is not quite as faithful of a remake as the Resident Evil 1 remake was, but it's still really, really good.

Pros:
Amazing visuals and sound.
Really gory and violent.
Old school RE level design and puzzles.
Comes with the original outfits for Claire & Leon.
Mr X is wearing a fedora.
Hardcore mode offers up a genuine challenge.
Lots of replayability.

Introduction

Resident Evil 2 is a remake of the original version and as a remake, there are a couple of differences between this newer version and the old one. One such difference is that this version opts to use the third person camera angle since it's alternative take that's fresh and fun. Others could be that there is no need to use ink ribbons on difficulties below hardcore and that they have created an atmosphere that is felt with tension. New enemies can appear in previously explored rooms while others will continually chase the players during most of the game. I think that Resident Evil 2 is trying to mix together aspects of the original with elements of RE 3 and RE 7. This is brilliant.

Gameplay

The gameplay is very solid and creative with the player having several options to manipulate rooms or enemies. The player can use a knife to cut zombies legs to incapacitate them in order to save ammunition or use the environment to escape chases more easily like with stairs in which zombies are slower or wooden barricades to slow down the horde. Weapons have a kick to them which makes them more enjoyable to use yet enemies are quite resilient to them, the player knows that their weapons can kill enemies with ease for the most part but they will eat all the ammunition fast. Classic Resident Evil games tend to have one particular element that decides if a run ends in success or failure and that is item management. However, do note that this version is more forgiving than it's previous ones.


The story remains the same for the most part, with small changes present that don't alter the take of the original. The developers did a pretty good job when it comes optimization as graphics cards such as GTX 1060 or 1070 will manage to run at 60+ FPS with everything on high/ultra. The game takes on a more darker-wet approach as areas feel desolated, murky, and with hidden dangers lurking around. While it borrows elements for newer entries, it still remains true to the original in most aspects.


The RE 7 style graphics are beautiful and breathtaking at times and the chases that happen through the main story keep the players focused, scared, wary and on their toes for the most part. Enemies had become even more dangerous than ever and even the simplest ones such as normal zombies or dogs are able to take you down with ease if you give them the chance. This game is a perfect quality title which everyone can play and enjoy, old fans will be in awe at the chance of reliving one of the best games ever made and new ones will have the chance to enjoy a classic revamped to their liking.


+ Revamped for new players, remade for old ones.
+ Adopts elements from newer entries with ease, making them it's own.
+ Has a good amount of base content and will get even more with free DLC.
+ 4th Survivor mode for all of those that love speedrunning and chewing more than they can bite.
+ 2nd run keeps the game fresh even after beating it. Remixing enemies, item placement and more.
+ Dynamic difficulty, it becomes ruthless if you are doing well and forgiving if you are having a hard time.
+ Superb graphics make the game look astounding, details give life to its creatures and surroundings.
+ Extremely dangerous enemies will chase the player through rooms, creating an atmosphere of tension and keeping players on their toes at all times.

- Some puzzles can be bananas to solve without a guide.
- William Birkin encounters are a disappointment in contrast to Mr. X.
- Lacks bosses, while there are some they sometimes get repeated and it feels like it should have more variety.
- Last bosses are rushed, they lack momentum and could have used a little more time to develop more tension.


Resident Evil 2 is a spectacular game and one in which it is hard for me to find any major weak points or cons. All I can think of it are good things due to its perfect balance and mastery over keeping alive it's true essence while adapting to modern times. I consider it to be a masterpiece in its own merit and must get game for every gamer who wants to enjoy a spectacular game.",Recommended," January 30, 2019"

That guy's a maniac! Why'd he bite me?!
Back in 1998 my dad bought me RE2 for the PS1 we had, I was only 10 years old and I played the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• outta that game with my bros and friends. It gave me lots of nightmares and was the game that introduced me to survival horror games and zombies. I've been a fan ever since of Resident Evil and horror games. Resident Evil 2 is my most favorite part of the franchise.

Capcom managed to create a perfect remake of it and it's scaring the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• outta me again. I'm glad to see them returning to the roots, as RE used to be scary <3. The atmosphere is so intense! When you play this, you might want to choose Hardcore difficulty. It feels close to the original. Although it can feel damn hard later on, when enemies are tough.

RE2 Remake is such a beautiful and fantastic game, it's everything I hoped the remake would be and more :). The zombies and other monsters are so well done, but especially the zombies... they're the best I've ever seen. It has been years since I was scared of zombies in games last time and this game right here make me scared of them again.

Voice acting and writing is excellent. The remade music is pretty good, but once I changed back to the original PS1 music on 2nd playthrough, it is a lot better in my opinion.

Playing this makes me quite emotional and part of it is because of nostalgia I guess. I like how much they've changed things, but at the same time places feel to be familiar. Older players like me expect something to happen in certain places, but then nothing happens because they switched things to give a fresh feeling.

I think think this is the best Resident Evil. This is how remakes should be done. I'm looking forward to the possible RE3 Remake and RE8, which is said to be revealed in 2020. Hopefully they keep the horror.",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

RE2 is a modern Resident Evil game: behind-the-shoulder action, smooth controls, gorgeous visuals, masterfully staged atmosphere and true surprises. RE2 is also a classic Resident Evil game: cheesy dialogue, tight corridors, police-station environs, lumbering zombies, and simple puzzles that rely on item fetching and backtracking.

I remember the original game: two CDs (one for each character), the animation scenes, and the ideal way to solve some puzzles. The developers created an incredible blend of past and present. You notice this from the first steps. The unfolding of the story is basically the same as its first version. But there are a number of surprises throughout the game that make the game look different.

Resident Evil 2 is a gift not only for franchise fans, but for all players. The game can balance the old and the new, with a faithful plot and room for new features to add, all along with graphics of the current generation and a completely revamped gameplay. Newcomers will likely discover a new favorite horror franchise to explore, while long-time followers of the series will find a sweet blend of familiarity and freshness.

THE GOOD
- Amazing graphics and visuals
- Perfectly claustrophobic sound
- Smooth camera and controls
- Campaign is well-structured
- Characters have been given extra depth


- Backtracking and item fetching
- Won't reinvent the horror-gaming wheel

I never thought I'd play another RE game after the traumatizing experience I had in RE:7 VR... Honestly, I'm way too easily scared to actually enjoy a horror game, and plus zombies aren't really my thing. Never quite understood how they became such a popular theme in the first place. But hey, I had a blast with RE:2. Playing it is stressful and nerve-wracking, and I still don't understand why I put myself through it, but I had to say this is overall a very refined and polished survival horror experience, and if you are a fan of this genre or franchise (which I'm not..) you'll most likely love it.

So, how scary is it? Well, for the record, I chickened out and chose the easier difficulty (shame on me -.-), so for me it was actually not as scary as I had prepared for, but still it got me good quite a few times.. probably also just because I'm so sh!te and that just balanced out the easy difficulty level. Anyway, it feels more survival and shooting than horror for me.

Then we have the puzzles. They are (thankfully) quite easy, and most of them just involves finding and collecting objects and installing them (or using them in some way) in the correct place. But of course, you'll have to deal with zombies and whatnots in the proccess of solving these puzzles, and that is the name of the game essentially.

My favourity aspect is the scarcity of the resource and your extremely limited inventory space, and that's obviously the core of the survival elements in this, as in previous titles. You really have to think what to take and what to throw away and make most use of what you have at hand, which is a lot of fun. Again, I'm so sh!te at scavenging stuff that by the time I beat the game I still only had a handgun and a granade launcher, so your mileage may vary...

On the technical side, this game looks AMAZING. I mean the graphics obviously. The actual things you are looking at are of course some of the ugliest and most horrifying zombies you'll ever see. But the graphics are gorgeous - lighting, texture, facial animation, gores, and everything. And it runs like a dream, I ran it with 2080 on a 3440x1440 monitor with pretty much everything on the highest setting and 120% scaling, and it can maintain at about 70-80 fps, which is pretty good if you ask me.

So, I had great fun with this, and I guess the verdict is if you are remotely interested in the survival horror genre you can't afford missing this one.",Recommended," January 28, 2019"

Resident Evil 2 is a remake of the game which was released in 1998. I never played the original version so this was a completely new experience for me.

The good

‚Ä¢ Play as either Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy. After you complete the game with one character, you can play a new game plus mode with the other character where the story will be slightly different, you‚Äôll meet different NPCs and find different weapons.
‚Ä¢ Excellent survival horror gameplay. Every enemy is legitimately dangerous if you don‚Äôt respect them, even the basic zombies. Ammo and health pickups are limited, so you have to be careful not to waste anything. Sometimes its best to avoid enemies and conserve ammo.
‚Ä¢ Enemies include zombies, lickers, dogs, a couple of strange mutants, and multiple bosses (who, in true Resident Evil style, just won‚Äôt stay dead).
‚Ä¢ Good weapon variety including handgun, magnum, SMG, shotgun, grenade launcher, shock rifle, flamethrower and minigun. Plus secondary weapons such as knife, flashbang and frag grenade that can be used to escape from enemies who grab you.
‚Ä¢ Some weapons and upgrades, like weapon mods and pouches to increase inventory size, are earned by solving puzzles, which rewards you for exploring.
‚Ä¢ Interesting locations including the Raccoon City police station, a nearby orphanage and an underground laboratory. The graphics look amazing, and the areas where the lights are out and you‚Äôre exploring with a flashlight helps to create a horror atmosphere.
‚Ä¢ Good story and great voice acting.
‚Ä¢ Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.
‚Ä¢ I didn‚Äôt suffer any bugs, crashes or framerate issues.

The bad

‚Ä¢ Inventory system is occasionally annoying because you‚Äôre not allowed to simply put an item on the floor and pick it up again later. Any item you drop is discarded forever, which means you sometimes have to go back to a storage box to free up space to pick up a quest item that needs to be used on an object 10 feet away.
‚Ä¢ ¬£45 feels a bit expensive for a game that takes 16 hours to beat twice.

The recommendation

Resident Evil 2 is an amazing game, a must play for every fan of the Resident Evil franchise, or survival horror games in general. I actually think this is my new favourite Resident Evil game (I‚Äôve previously played 0,1,4,5,6,7, Revelations 1&2). Don‚Äôt hesitate to pick it up next time its on sale.",Recommended," August 28, 2019"

A beyond perfect reimagining of Resident Evil 2. Blew away all of my expectations (and I had some sky-high ones) and terrified me $h1tless. My favorite RE is Resident Evil 1 Remake but now, I'm not so sure. This game right here is what you call a masterpiece, and as good as a remake can possibly get.

Downright phenomenal. - 10/10

UPDATE upon completing the ""2nd Run"": Overarching story is present over the A/B scenarios, but major story element inconsistencies really screw up the timeline. I understand some elements are the way they are for gameplay purposes, but you simply cannot show two sides of different coins in a single playthrough. Still, this does little to affect the overall game's excellence. Just don't think too much about it.

Final score - 9.5/10 (for incoherence)",Recommended," January 28, 2019"

Rating: 9/10
Genre: Third Person Survival Horror

The Good:
+ Every room/location/area is dripping with atmosphere. Capcom spared no expense in making sure that everything feels perfect in how it looks. The game also supports an impressive amount of graphical options, each option shows you what it effects, how much ram it utilizes and how the image will look like.

+ The game finds the right balance between survival horror and action especially in the harder difficulties where you have to make tough decision whether you fight or run to conserve resources.

+ Every area is very designed; the game lets you explore at your own pace without holding you hand but also ensures you are constantly making progress

+ The map screen provides valuable information like showing you which rooms you have collected every item, which doors require certain keys, and the map automatically shows you which items are in a room so long as you look at the item directly. All of this, leads to an easy to navigate environment and allows you to make decision quicker in which items you want to take with you and what items you want to leave behind.

+ Both Leon and Claire get access to there own set of weapons, and each weapon feels satisfying to use. Shooting zombies causes brain matter to splatter, chunks of flesh to fall off, bones that shatter etc.

+ The bonus DLC is free courtesy of Capcom although compared to the main game is a lot more frustrating and unforgiving. The DLC is reused areas from the main game with a lot more enemies a lot fewer resources.

+ Mods that can change the game, although the majority of them are just specific outfits for Claire.

+ Fantastic soundtrack

The Average:
+/- My biggest complaint is more of a missed opportunity for the game. Both Leon and Claire campaigns are essentially two completely different games that share some similarities. I feel it would have been a lot more effective if Capcom treated the game as one story being told from two different perspectives where the actions in Scenario A carry over to Scenario B.

+/- Story and dialogue were never a strong aspect of the Resident Evil franchise and this game is no different. The overall plot is pretty basic and certain plot/story elements are not explained compared to the original.

Conclusion:
A fantastic remake that does a great job of being faithful to the original.",Recommended," October 27, 2019"

Ok, so...
1. I usually get nervous about games of the survival horror genre, because they are often unfair, prolonged and based on a twin-like gameplay
2. For the first time in my life I played a game from the series Resident Evil (yea).
3. I watched all the movies from ""Resident Evil"" series and all I liked (for many films are weak, but I'm a noob)
4. I did not know who is Mr. X, Claire, Leon etc.

BUT

RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE: 2 is the best Survival Horror game I've ever played!

The game masterfully raises the level of difficulty, we are not thrown into the deep water in the first minute of the game. Each new player in this series may approach the game and if he does not get rid of himself or does not withdraw from fear, he will definitely finish.
Every fan and noob in this genre should play!
The first meeting with Mr. X, and later listening to some will probably be remembered.

During the whole game I did not even hit one bug, the game works very smoothly, the optimization as well as graphics, sound is the top level. This is one of the best ports and remakes in recent years.

The game is very well balanced, at the beginning we count every bullet, we use meds carefully, and at the highest level of difficulty even the number of saves are limited.

For the most demanding players there are many challenges with rewards such as alternative clothes for characters.

The game is created to pass it at least twice to get to know the real ending. However, you can complete the game up to 4 times to get to know 100% of the content.

Are there any significant defects?
If you are not overly nervous or stupid (the game will punish you for your stupidity) then there are no disadvantages.

So it is finally here and it is all you could wish for but...

Gameplay is appropriately tuned, they seem to have hit a sweet spot between modern mechanics and old school tanky controls. I would say they made the right choice to go with an over the shoulder view as well as this adds tension and gives more of a panicky feel whenever you get grabbed by a zombie for example.

I definitely appreciate all the little details they incorporated like being able to retrieve your knife from a zombie as well as being able to use defense weapons as normal weapons as well, it is a huge upgrade over the original remake defense system just to mention an example of how much thought went into making the gameplay enjoyable. These things are hard to get right.

The graphics are as always the best you will find and level design is amazing. The attention to detail is out of this world and setting a new bar for all other developers with things like dead body collision. No longer will dead bodies magically merge together but instead they fall on top of each other giving you that much more of a realistic feel to everything happening. Heck zombies will even trip over dead bodies, now if that isn't attention to detail then I don't know what is.

Now Capcom said even though this is a remake they treated this as an entirely new game but nevertheless don't think that this means they forgot about the original as tiny things and major story events happen just as you would expect them to and I for one as a fan know how to appreciate that. Without spoiling anything you will recognize a lot of the scenes from the original RE2 albeit they might happen at a different time. As for the tiny things that you would recognize like , these will mostly happen during a ""2nd run"" aka B scenario. They did not include this in the first playthrough to keep things fresh and new and that makes sense but you certainly can appreciate these things during a 2nd playthrough.

Speaking of the second scenario now this is where things start to get seriously grim. The campaign is definitely not as long as it used to be in the original (even if you explore every inch) and I was willing to ignore this if the second scenario would be an actual new scenario as you would then count both of them together in terms of campaign time then but I can't get myself to do that.
From the get-go you feel awkward as the game automatically takes you to the RPD but hey it is a new area so you shake it off until you find out that after this one new area you basically get back to following the same steps as you did during your first playthrough. There are a couple of different areas to explore but nothing fits together with the timeline of the first campaign. None of the items you took during the first playthrough are used, and where the hell did the item box from the main hall go? Did Mr. X carry it outside or something? You can tell they added some new areas and a couple different bosses but for the majority of the game both characters fight the exact same bosses in the same area at the same time. The two scenarios just can't happen in the same universe so basically you can't even make out what the canon flow of events in this game is.

And this is where you realise Capcom got lazy with the game, the 2nd scenario is for about 80% the same thing as the 1st scenario. Don't get me wrong, gameplaywise it is something different but I would call this more like an enhanced ""Arrange mode"" from the classic games than an entirely different scenario. There simply isn't enough content to justify being so lazy with the second campaign in a story-driven game like this.

All in all I love the game, it is a perfect remake as long as you don't look at the second campaign and contentwise there is a free new mode coming called ""The Ghost Survivors"" so that should help the value proposition but the fan in me can't help but be somewhat disappointed that they did not give the second campaign the treatment it deserved",Recommended," January 27, 2019"

Resident Evil 2 is one of the better horror games out there in the market. This game is the complete remake of the original Resident Evil 2 released in 1998. This remake lives up to its expectation and delivered a classic survival horror game while keeping the theme of the original game intact. This remake will be enjoyed by both new players and the players who played the original one.

Game Type
Survival Horror (with gun play)

Gameplay/View
Third Person View. You either play as Leon or Claire, the two protagonists in the game. You have to survive from enemies and complete puzzles to proceed towards the objective.

Difficulty
Have three difficulty settings suitable for both beginner and hardcore players.


Between 12 to 15 hrs for one campaign playthrough.


Pistol (4-5 variety of pistols), SMG, Shotgun, Grenade Launcher. There are some exclusive weapons like rocket launcher, Machine gun etc. only available in certain boss fights.


There are many items or equipment which the player can gather in their walkthrough. Items ranges from Knife, Grenade, flashbang, herbs (for healing and curing any status like poison) and some other.


Players can combine two items to create a new item that ranges from ammo, healing herbs.


The game encourages the players to explore the areas. A lot of mission items and special items/ equipment are scattered throughout the area and it is essential to explore the areas.


Enemy AI is great. Loud noises from running, gunfire can attract enemies from a distance. There are quite a few enemy types/varieties ranging from zombies, dogs, lickers, swamp monsters and some others. In addition to normal enemies and zombies, the player is chased by special enemies in certain areas. In the early part of the game the infamous Tyrant (Mr X) will be stalking the player throughout the level in the early part. While some players may get frustrated, this chase/stalking of Mr X is a critical/ fundamental part of this game and the players will feel a sense of accomplishment once they manage to overcome this part. Boss fights are decent although there could have been some improvement.



All of them are excellent which when combined together recreate a true horror feeling among the players.


Good replay ability value. The player had to complete the game twice to get the true ending. This has to be done with the two characters Leon and Claire. Note that the player had to do the second playthrough (entitled second run). There are certain modes like Survival modes, NPC scenarios which unlocks once a player completes a playthrough.


Killing an enemy is not recommended unless absolutely necessary since ammo is scarce. (it takes a huge number of bullets to kill an enemy Crippling an enemy (shooting in the leg) is an effective way to conserve ammo and complete objectives faster.
All the items/mission items should be checked and inspected since it can reveal new features which otherwise can be over looked. For example, a badge (used for unlocking locker) on proper inspection can change into a USB dongle that can be used to access a computer.

Inventory management is important since the number of inventory slots are limited and some items can occupy 2 slots. It is essential to keep at least 2-3 slots free before the player decides to investigate a particular area. It may happen that the player run out of inventory slots while coming in front of a mission item. The player can drop items/ammo to make space but those ammos and items are quite hard to come by.

The player had to backtrack a lot in this game so it is essential that the player gets accustomed with the map/area.
A player can check on dead bodies/zombies using their knife (and not waste bullet) to check if they are actually dead or not. Otherwise the bodies can suddenly reanimate and can catch the player off guard.


There is no dodging in the game. The player must make each step with caution. Always keep a knife or two equipped so that if an enemy catches a player off guard, the player can snap out of the enemy grab/bite with their trusty knife.


9/10. Definitely recommended. Capcom have really showed us as how remakes are actually made!",Recommended, May 23

Feels really great, never played the original...and now I don't have to.
It is also very well optimized, you don't need a beast to play this. On Windows 10 with my GTX 970 on 1080p, I get 55-60 fps with 1GB textures and all settings maxed except shadows (Medium), Ambient occlusion (HDAO) and Antialiasing (FXAA+TAA).

If you've played any recent titles, navigating is a breeze. My only gripe so far is zombies won't stalk you everywhere. They could have factored this into the skill system making it even more fun (and tense on higher difficulties).

Lastly I still don't understand why people have to compare everything and complain about everything:
-The developers made some changes and improvements you don't like, so you complain.
-But if they made it an exact 1:1 replica of the original you will still complain.

Either way you will not be satisfied, learn to enjoy a game for what it is.

Amazing. Simply, amazing.

Eighteen years ago it was Capcom who created what is perhaps the greatest video game remake of all time with the unforgetable RE1 Remake and after a long history of successes, downfalls and rising back again to restore the RE in its former glory with RE7, it is Capcom again that delivers another near perfect remake of a legendary game and deiver a game of unparalleled quality beyond the highest expectations. It was an extremely tough task, but they did it.
Yes it's THAT good.

RE2 Remake, brings Racoon City's doomed police department to life in way that was not possible before, graphics that truly immerse you with their dark dilapidated corridors and offices, eerily empty parking lots, streets and sewers filled with the smell of death, and all that accompanied by some extraordinary sound that enhances the atmosphere of dread beyond belief. Perhaps the sound design is the true star of this action horror adventure that raises the stakes as you dive deeper into the cospiracy that led to the zombie apocalypse.
The story is more streamilined compared to the original, perfectly suited for newcomers to the series but also offering new twists and takes for old fans already familliar with the source material, in a similar way the previous RE1 Remake played with players' expectations by tweaking and adding new things into the mix. While RE2 is not as daring in the introduction of new elements as its predecessor was, it makes up with the amazing quality of its presentation, leaps and bounds beyond its competition (seriously the cutscenes alone make this one of the most beautiful games so far, with great voice talent, superb acting and intensity that puts the likes of David Cage's ""emotional scenes"" in shame!) - something you would never expect from a franchise that once upon a time gave us the ""Jill sandwich""!
Capcom has surpassed themselves and the evolution of the RE Engine is even more impressive than the expressions and motion capturing we saw in RE7.

Gameplay wise, while it uses the over-the-shoulder angle that the franchise revolutionized with RE4, the game is a pure survival horror action adventure, with all the trappings, limited inventory space, ammo & health management, backtracking, and solving puzzles (albeit not as intricate as RE1), while trying to stay alive as you face hideous monstrosities and tough boss battles. One thing that is a welcome return compared to the more repetitive enemies of RE7 is the wide variety of foes, from the classic zombies, to the disgusting lickers and of course the main highlight, the unstoppable ""Terminator"" Mr.X who now stalks the entire station, randomly searching for you and attracted to the sound of your gunfire, requiring a more tactical approach, as opposed to the few scripted events of the PS1 version.
As with its old incarnation, once you finish the campaign with one hero, you unlock a 2nd run to play with the second character, featuring an alternative storyline in order to unlock the true ending.
The game also offers three different difficulty modes so people of all types of skill can enjoy the game, with ASSISTED (weaker enemies, aimassist, more resources and partial health regeneration), STANDARD (the normal mode) and for fansof frustrating survival horror of the good ol'days HARDCORE (far stronger enemies, less resources and the return of the famous ink ribbons in order to save).
And that's not all. Once you complete the main game, you can try your luck (and patience) with its small array of bonus missions, mostly aimed at speedrunners, with tough challenging action-arcade gameplay, as you control various supporting characters throughout a variety of locations. While not the greatest content, these are FREE unlockable modes so it is always welcomed.
And as you complete various tasks during either the main campaign or the bonus content, you slowly unlock the game's gallery where you can not only see some wonderful concept art but also the 3d models of the entire cast of heroes and villains and their animations, plus completing the main game rewards you with the original PS1 outfits for the main cast updated for the curent incarnation,or if you want a stronger nostalgia shot you can download the FREE '98 versions of the two main heroes in all their polygonal glory - the extra content you can unlock and enjoy is an oasis in the current half-baked dlc-driven environment in the industry.

Speaking of DLC , yes there are some minor stuff here as well, although nothing too essential, mostly cosmetic but cool-looking costumes (with a fun one being the Noir versions of the characters where you also play the game entirely in black & white!!!) or nods to the cancelled 1.5 version with Elza Walker costume for Claire, and perhaps the only really important DLC being that of the original soundtrack/sound effects of the PS1 game which you can enable in game to complete your trip in memory lane. However I must admit that the new soundtrack for this remake is absolutely amazing!

Capcom has once again made a great port for the PC, with many different graphical options to tweak. The game is very well optimized and even in an average and somewhat weak machine as mine, it would run quite well. I didn't encounter any bug or problem whatsoever.

Capcom and the resident Evil franchise are now standing in a very crucial moment, with the upcoming release of RE3 remake one wonders if they will be able to repeat the success once again and deliver another high quality title. However, the opportunities for remakes are becoming less and less viable as time goes by and at one point the question will again arise: When is RE8? And what path will it follow, since the franchise has delivered stellar experiences in both 1st and 3rd person?

Until that time comes, we can relive our memories of the S.T.A.R.S. unit and Leon & Claire, their friends and foes, once more and remind ourselves why we loved them in the first place.",Recommended, January 26

Hallelujah! Seems the horror is here to stay!

Hot on the heels of the return-to-survival-horror excellence that was Resident Evil 7, this long-rumoured remake of RE2 retains not only the same engine as RE7, but the same hard-as-nails atmosphere. Gory, grimy, gritty, and all those other great things that RE7 delivered in spades...with just enough cheese to still make it a Capcom game, of course.

For the old fans: it's all here. Everything you would want in the year of our Lord 2019; unless you're the type who thought the best thing about the original RE2 was the cringy dialogue and delirious over-acting. (Not I!) And for the new fans: no need to fret over all that talk of ""tank controls"", awkward inventory systems, etc...those are long gone. This plays much the same as RE7, only in third person. It's a very, very modern game in most conceivable ways...minus all those tiresome contemporary ""open world"" and ""multiplayer"" antics that have conspired to ruin the horror genre in recent years. Heck, they've even managed to remove some of the original game's less logical architectural flourishes, e.g. no more statue-pushing puzzles in common areas, that could be accidentally budged by clueless members of the general public!

I have only one remotely notable criticism to make, and looking at forums and other reviews, I'm far from alone in feeling this. Simply put, the ""regular"" zombies are insanely unpredictable in terms of how many head shots it can take to kill them. I realise this is a bit of a carry-over from the old games, where you actually aim for the head; so the idea was that your character was usually hitting the body a bunch of times before finally nailing that critical head shot. Now that we can aim, a la RE4 and beyond...it does feel a little absurd to be shooting zombies in the skull many times before they stop getting back up. But you get used to it, and the only ways they could've countered this would be to give us MORE ZOMBIES or LESS AMMO: either of which would've been equally controversial. I suspect Capcom would've endured complaints about this conundrum no matter they chose to ""solve"" it, so it's an acceptable enough decision all 'round.

I'm not gonna say a great deal beyond that. I have a gazillion reviews before this analysing what I believe does and doesn't work in horror games. Short version: this one does virtually everything right, and I can't see it displeasing anyone bar the whiniest of whiney-bottoms. You want a bona fide horror video game? You got one. And yes: it is the $60 asking price (not least of all because of the extremely high replay value, courtesy of a wide range of differing scenarios and protagonists).

Stop procrastinating and just buy it already, ya great big scaredy-pants. The chances of us getting a better horror game this year are slim to say the least (especially since no Outlasts or Evil Withins are presently scheduled)!

Verdict: 10/10.

What a phenomenal remake. I grew up playing the Resident Evil games, and I vividly remember spending most of my nights eyes glued to our old CRT TV screen while my older sister and I blasted through Resident Evil 2. The way Capcom handled this remake deserves all kinds of praise on it's own accord. Overwhelmingly positive is an understatement compared to how much of a crown jewel this game really is. I feel like I'm playing exactly what I played during my childhood but in the most beautiful graphics out to date while also adding a bit of a fresh experience to the mix. As a diehard fan of the series I whole-heartedly give this a 10/10. I really hope Capcom continues to move forward with this formula when it comes to remaking their classic games. I'm hoping at some point we get to see a Resident Evil 1 and 3 remake in this style, as well as a Dino Crisis remake. Now that would be absolutely something to look forward too. Even at $60 this game is well worth the price, and I think anyone who has love for this franchise should add this to their Steam library.",Recommended," October 3, 2019"

The original RE2 was released in 1998, to critical acclaim and over 5 million copies sold across all the platforms it came out for. Now, the survival horror classic has been remade with a new engine, crisper graphics and a change of camera perspective, for a new generation of gamers. How has the result been?

To clarify, i have never played the original RE2. I only knew about the major story arcs and details thanks to Youtube videos and wikis.

Pros:
*Story is overall faithful to the original game, but with some new twists and changes to keep things fresh. The game is more of a ""re-imagining"" than a shot-for-shot remake.
*Gameplay has been updated while still remaining reminiscent to the original, the most obvious being the changed camera perspective, from fixed angels over pre-rendered backgrounds to a 3rd-person perspective in a true 3D world.
*The scare-factor is high, all from regular Zombies, dark corners and ambient noises work together to achieve a great atmosphere that keeps you tense. Even veterans of the original game will be suprised and caught off guard a few times.
*, the tyrant who before was relegated to scripted encounters is now able to track you in several sections of the game. This makes him a much bigger threat than before.
*All the extra modes from the original (except the Extreme Battle mode) make a return in addition to some new ones.
*The game sticks to survival horror and doesn't get too action-oriented.

Cons:
*The 2nd run, replacement for the B scenarios in the original, is very underwhelming. The story is 99% the same as in the respective character's A scenario, just with minor plot sections removed. It also creates some questionable plot holes (such as being killed by in Claire's scenario, yet showing up again as the in Leon's run, no worse for wear). Compare this to the original, where the stories ran parallell with each other and decisions you made in A could affect the B run.
*Some of the bosses end up being tedious, not that hard or difficult to figure out. Not completely uncommon in the series to be fair.
*Replay value isn't as high compared to the original.
*Certain plot changes feel less impactful or satisfying compared to the original

Overall though, the RE2 remake is a great game and a worthy purchase, especially on a first playthrough if you're craving some survival horror. Repeat playthroughs do get a bit more tedious, compared to the earlier games.

Final score: 8/10.",Recommended, February 9

An ingenious blend of the old and the new. This is how you modernize a classic!

Here it is, the remake everyone's been anticipating, and boy has it been worth it! It's everything one can ask from a remake. It modernized all the right bits without compromising the spirit and core principles of the original. This is not your typical ""streamlined"" AAA game: no, it respects the player's intelligence every bit as much as the original does! Most important of all, it's damn terrifying! And those times when it's not, it's always tense. Resident Evil 2 is an authentic survival horror experience, worthy of carrying the title.

The gameplay on a surface level is more reminiscent of Resident Evil 4 than the older games, but the focus is now once again on horror instead of the shooting elements. The shooter gameplay has been mostly inherited from the modern RE titles, but it's not about going in with guns blazing this time around. Zombies are now actual zombies, those Romero-style shambling, rotting corpses that trudge toward you if you're unfortunate enough to catch their attention. Gone are the parasite-infested villagers of Resident Evil 4 and subsequent titles.

In true old school Resident Evil fashion, killing zombies is satisfying and provides safety because you don't have to worry about that particular zombie when traversing the area in the future, but you'll often have to consider whether you want to conserve ammo or dispatch a zombie. Do you *really* have to kill this zombie; should you ingest these herbs now, or should you risk it and take one more hit before healing for maximized efficiency? The scarcity of ammunition and healing resources gives value to them, and finding bullets or healing often makes you sigh from relief. I'm a huge fan of this design because it makes the player really appreciate the resources given to them. It's more than just ""loot"". This scarcity of resources, unfortunately, became less of a factor toward the end of the game as I found myself more or less swimming in ammunition. But in the middle and especially beginning of the game, it's a huge factor and serves to add to the unrelenting suspense. Leaving zombies ""alive"" is unsettling but sometimes necessary, especially on the hardcore difficulty.

One problem with the combat is that it seems to be affected by randomization to quite a large degree. Sometimes you have to put around ten bullets in a zombie's head, but other times they may go down in a few shots. On top of the already randomized damage, there seems to be some kind of critical hit mechanic in play which randomly causes a zombie's head to explode into a gory mist. This can lead to frustrating inconsistency issues. I suspect it may be to encourage the dismemberment of enemies by shooting their limbs, and that is an effective strategy indeed, as severing a zombie's leg reduces them to slow, comparatively harmless crawlers that can be skirted with relative ease.

I could speak of the highly polarizing Tyrant enemy here, but I consider divulging details about it a major spoiler. I think it's best encountered blind as knowing beforehand would spoil the surprise.

The areas of the original game have been beautifully and faithfully recreated in this remake. One major contrast between the original and remake is that the remake's areas tend to be a lot darker, and a flashlight is often needed. This only increases their eeriness and puts the game's beautiful lighting effects to use. Thorough exploration is rewarded, as there is plenty of optional treasure to find for perceptive players. You'll come across many lockers with combination locks, locked safes, and the like. The number of enemies scattered around the environments feels right. Enemies don't respawn; rather, they spawn at set scripted points of the story. This, I feel, was the right design choice as it allowed the developers to carefully balance the amount of resources given to the player throughout the game. The spawning of enemies is also congruent with the story pacing of the game.

In addition to avoiding or killing zombies and managing resources, a major gameplay element in RE2 is solving puzzles. These come in large varieties. Some of them are more difficult, some slightly easier, but they're all well put together. Like mentioned earlier, the game respects the player's intelligence and doesn't treat them like a child. The puzzles are mostly challenging enough to confer the player a rewarding sense of accomplishment. This sense of accomplishment extends to every aspect of the game because it doesn't hold the player's hand excessively.

There is some additional convenience that was absent in the original, but none of this added convenience really detracts from the game's spirit. One example is that for doors that require a certain key, the required key type is now marked on the map for you unlike in the originals. It simply means that you don't need to memorize a bunch locks around the map‚Äîor in a perhaps more likely scenario, run around trial & erroring your keys for every possible door because you've forgotten which door demands what key!

Resident Evil 2 is a well-paced adventure that mostly stays consistently strong from beginning to end, with a slightly weaker sewer section in the middle. The gameplay and environments boast sufficient variety to avoid monotony. Your weapon arsenal is also upgraded throughout the adventure with increasingly destructive zombie disposal tools. In addition to new weapons being unlocked, you will also come across upgrades for your existing weapons that are mostly found by solving optional puzzles. They spice up the weapons handily and also make for a strong impetus for scouring every nook and cranny.

Graphically, the game is marvelous and runs well maxed out on my GTX 1060 6GB, i5 6600k rig. There's the occasional stutter when the game is loading‚Äîthere are no loading screens and it loads on the fly‚Äîbut other than that it runs flawlessly. Animations, effects, character models, and everything else is state of the art. The sound design is also phenomenal and adds to the game's atmosphere in a big way.

I didn't particularly care for the remake's soundtrack, though, but fortunately there is a DLC available that brings back the mostly excellent soundtrack of the original game. Ultimately, it's of course a question of preference, but I much preferred playing with the original soundtrack. The remake's music is leaning more toward seemingly indiscriminate, amelodic ambient noise whereas the original soundtrack features more melodic, yet still terrifying, and memorable pieces.

This is the best AAA game I've played since Dark Souls, and there haven't been many good ones in between. It's a remarkable game in every aspect. It brings the scares but also outstanding gameplay, puzzles, cutscenes, graphics, and atmosphere. If RE7 wasn't a return to form for the series (I didn't play it), then this surely is! I've had a blast with it, and I fervently hope that Capcom make a Resident Evil 3 remake. It'll be a day 1 purchase. My faith in the AAA games industry has been restored a little.

Resident Evil 2 is a gorgeous remake we all deserve. A survival horror game that makes an epic comeback for the fans of the series and a perfect way to introduce to the masterpiece game for the newcomers.

Pros:

+ Gorgeous graphics
+ An amazing remake that manages to save the atmosphere and the idea of the classic game and brings us a brand new visuals
+ Astonishing creepy horrifying atmosphere
+ A strong feeling of the survival horror at its finest
+ Rich and captivating story, that makes you want to know what will happen next
+ Numerous collectibles to find, perfect for the achievement hunters
+ Logical puzzles that never feel out of place
+ Two story modes with different characters with alternative versions of the story
+ Challenging bonus modes after completing the main game to entertain yourself
+ Brilliant sound design
+ Convincing design of the monsters and creatures



- Can be frustrating sometimes with its pacing, where the player has no idea where to go next
- Some of the enemies require to spend way too much ammo to get rid of them, so sometimes the best option is to let them be

For the last few years, we were lucky enough to get a proper remake for a few games from our childhood. My personal opinion that this is an absolutely amazing way to please the fans of the classic old games and also a good thing to let the younger players, who are afraid to launch these old games with outdated graphics, to introduce to some great titles.

And now we have Resident Evil 2 - the game that looked so scary to me when I was a kid. It looked completely unbearable for my age and I never understood how to play it properly. So it was my chance to finish what I started back in the days.


Resident Evil 2 tells us a story of a recruit of the Raccoon City police named Leon who arrives on his service on his first day and finds out that the deadly virus affected the whole city. Now, he has to partner up with a beautiful girl called Claire - probably, the only person he can trust in this madness - and figure out what happened to the citizens and do whatever it takes to stop the contagion from spreading.


The game starts by showing us the start of the adventure of Leon and Claire and how they meet each other. At the very beginning of the game, they get separated and continue their own journeys. This is a very important note because after you finish the game once, you will get the opportunity to play it for the second time with another character to see the alternative version of the story from their perspective. Make sure to choose the right option from the menu, it should be marked with an orange dot and called ‚Äúsecond run‚Äù. I thought it would be a good idea to clarify it because it seems that a lot of players get confused about that fact, and think that after they finish the game once with one character, the game is over.

In Resident Evil 2 you should always remember that this is a classical survival horror, where every single bullet should be counted and you have to play it safe, especially on the higher difficulties. The player always has to explore as much as possible to find every note, clue, and notebook to find codes for the safes and locks, because this is where you can find valuable upgrades for your guns and inventory.

I really enjoyed how they managed to keep the exploration thing and it‚Äôs still one of the most important mechanics of the game. Resident Evil 2 requires you to do a lot of backtracking and check your map quite often to remind yourself where is your next destination. That makes the whole gameplay thing very intense because you have to think about your ammo, remember about the location of the rooms where you need to get in and always be careful with the enemies around you. Also, it has a fair amount of puzzles, that add some value to the exploration and they never feel like they are out of place.

The game really changed and evolved a lot in terms of combat and gunplay: it looks completely gorgeous and very effective every time you shoot in your enemies‚Äô heads. However, most of the enemies are a bit hard to take down and you will need a lot of bullets to do this. You should be careful because in this case, you risk to stay low on ammo when it comes to boss fights and trust me, you don‚Äôt want to be empty during these battles. I understood for myself that it‚Äôs not necessary to kill every single enemy in the game and sometimes it‚Äôs a good idea to avoid wasting your ammo on another random enemy when you can just run away.

Another important thing worth mentioning is, of course, the remastered version of Mr. X - the annoying, slow and enormous giant that follows you all the time, appearing out of nowhere and giving you hard times at the most inconvenient moments. This guy is probably one of the most memorable bosses in the game, especially during Leon‚Äôs playthrough. His terrifying footsteps around you will definitely give you goosebumps for the whole game and this is very atmospheric.

My biggest complaint regarding Resident Evil 2 is that it was kinda short - it only has a few locations and I was able to complete the game in 5 hours and 30 minutes for the first playthrough and it only took me a little bit more than two hours to complete Claire‚Äôs story, simply because most of the things that you have to do are completely similar, so I knew exactly what to do next most of the time.

After finishing their stories, the game will introduce you extra modes called 4th survivor and a Tofu Survivor. Both of the modes are fun challenges, that merge few locations from the original game and require you to get to the extraction point. These modes are completely opposite to the main game and they were made to relax and have fun, especially in Tofu survivor, where you have to escape with a giant Tofu guy using knives only.


Resident Evil 2 Remake isn‚Äôt just a slight touch with a renewed HD textures pack, it‚Äôs a sterling recreation of the classic original game. Every single character, model and location look absolutely amazing and you can really feel how dedicated the developers are. They managed to create a completely new game and save every single important detail of the original product. And this is simply brilliant.


The sound is something that has been fully changed in this remake as well and it‚Äôs absolutely outstanding. I was playing this game using my headphones to fully dive into the atmosphere of this horror and it was unbelievable. I heard absolutely everything - from the Mr. X footsteps on the second floor to the enemies‚Äô cries outside the police station, mixed with dramatic sounds on the background at the most intense moments.


This game is a perfect example of what the proper remake should look like. Resident Evil 2 is a masterpiece survival horror that feels a bit short, but it‚Äôs absolutely worth it. Let‚Äôs hope that this game will start a series of successful remakes for some other classic titles because this is something that we really need.

Its manically detailed environments, amazing voice acting, smooth combat mechanics and mind-blowing graphics make this game an outstanding achievement in the Resident Evil series and also in recent video game history.

Survival horror became the huge market it is today thanks to titles like Resident Evil, and all the elements that made the first entries in the series classics are present in this game, refreshed and revisited for newer audiences and platforms.

Make Zombies Scary Again

The whole thing with zombies was that they were undead creatures. This meant, in the beginning, that they were terrifying on their own. How could you kill something that was already dead? As this shock value grew thin over time, the entertainment industry (including video games, TV and film) seemed to automatically shift from horror to action. This change could also be seen in the Resident Evil franchise, especially in , arguably the least scary in the series. A return to the basics was long overdue, and Resident Evil 2 did it flawlessly. Zombies can't be killed easily in this game, and if you take the risk, there's always a chance that they might actually kill you. You have to be careful every time you are around them. And as weapons are on short supply, often running might actually be your best shot.


The level of immersion that the graphics and the sound design in this game give you is a great part of what makes it work so well. Every inch of the city feels alive, filled with a level of detail that can only be achieved through hard work and a masterful artistic direction. Every step you take makes you feel like you're actually there. All locations have just the right ambient sounds to make you feel that. This makes the whole experience realistic and honest, and the scary moments ten times scarier.


I just had to mention it. The design put into Tyrant (or as everyone is calling it, Mr. X) is just fascinating. Ever since you first encounter it you won't feel safe in the game anymore. While most games these days make you feel like an unstoppable killing machine, Mr. X makes you feel small and helpless. An element that was worked into the experience in such a way that makes it fit perfectly into the terrifying orchestra that Resident Evil 2 is.


In my opinion, this game is worth every penny. From the way it makes you experience fear intimately and deeply to the remarkable graphic and sound design, Resident Evil 2 is an experience hardcore fans of the series and new players can enjoy. Definitely a must play.",Recommended," November 12, 2019"

Well, it's been more than one year that I'm thinking to buy RESIDENT EVIL 2 Remake, I wasn't tempted to be honest. But with the last sales, I finally decided to pull the trigger.... And like some of my other Steam games, I should have buy RE2R earlier.

Yeah, this game is really really good and amazing! I'm played a lot the original version from 1998 on my PlayStation 1 (I have the game and the console. Both still working nowaday), and the remake bring back the awesomeness and many good memories from the first iteration.
The visual quality, lighting effects, animations, puzzles and the ambiance are top notch! And with the PC version, you can use some good mods. Simply one of the best horror/survival game.

Capcom made a 20+ years old classic game to an excellent 2019 game.

This game has a special type of fun. What kind of fun is that? It's like... Sort of like... l... let me spell it for you!


F is for F**K, MISTER X IS COMING RIGHT AT ME
U is for UNAVOIDABLE LICKER IN THE HALLWAY
N is for NO HERBS, AMMO OR GRENADES LEFT


Adversity is a thing that sounds like no fun at all, but this game and a certain popular game that involves rolling around and whacking undead people in the back make it surprisingly enjoyable. RE2: Remake absolutely is a return to more hardcore zombie survival games compared to the iffy bizzare adventure RE6 and modern zombie survival games that let you mow down a bunch of undead folk like no tomorrow.

UPDATE: I have completed 1st Run with Leon and 2nd Run with Claire. This is easily my favorite Resident Evil and replaces Resident Evil 1 in my all time top ten. Yeah that's right. This game is in my all time top ten list. What a masterpiece.

I haven't completed the game yet, but I can tell you, it's a dream come true. I actually didn't play the original RE2, but many other RE games, including the remaster of the first one, which up until now was my favorite, but honestly, I think this is by far the best one, and I say that as someone who would put RE1 on his top ten list of all time. This is what Doom 2016 was for fps, but for survival horror. Oldschool in the best way possible and modernized in the best way possible. The graphics are INSANE, but the game still runs like butter, with 100 fps at 1440p with a GTX 1080 and I5-4690k (outdated CPU).

This game has some of the most intense moments I ever experienced in video games, and all of that purely through gameplay.",Recommended," January 29, 2019"

My first RE game; always interested, but always avoided due to poor reviews due to porting issues. This remake took care of that, and I was glad I was able to experience.

What makes this game stand out is great game design/level design. This is top notch. The area you can explore expands optimally as the game unfolds; always plenty to explore, never too big to get truly lost. For a good part of the game my survival was not assured.

Combat and puzzles are both well done and sufficiently satisfying. I was only stuck a couple of times. Ammo is scare, which like System Shock 2, is a good thing as it adds to the challenge. Graphics are very good with the remake, music and sound effects are solid.

Plot and dialog are average fare for the genre, good enough to keep interest.

This is an easy recommendation on sale for any FPS/horror (mild) fan.

Resident Evil 2 is a full remake of the 1998 Classic ps1 title, and does a fantastic job of it. This honestly should be amongst the standards of how remakes are judged from this point onward. It changes just enough to be modernized but doesn't make itself unrecognizable from its original iteration.

What do I mean exactly? First and easiest example of this is the perspective and controls. The original being in fixed flat images to simulate the feel of a 3D environment, obviously something had to be changed for today, they perfectly rebuilt the world in 3D models and gave a 3rd person over the shoulder perspective. I know what everyone is thinking ""oh great... they turned it into Resident Evil 4"" not exactly thank god. While it shares its perspective and basic game-play with RE4, the game-play itself is a lot less action orientated, centering around evasion and actually bringing the sense of danger back to the single zombie. You cannot defend yourself from a grapple move unless you have a defense sub weapon, so no ""counter waltz"" dancing from one end of the map to the next like in RE4. You will actually need to play intelligently. Also enemies got redesigns to their mechanics to make things more interesting. Its also genuinely nice to have a knife and not feel you've got a worthless hunk of metal in your hands like the originals.

One downside(?) 3 core enemies got cut from this version of the game; The crows, The moth, and the Spiders. To be honest I am glad the crows got cut from the game otherwise without a massive overhaul to their mechanics (like adding in huge moments where they stood still to get a chance to shoot them) they would have just been annoyances to the game. I do kinda miss the spiders and moths but I can't say I'd have liked to see a spider as detailed as the ones in this game. So while this negative is convenient to me, its still a negative and I wish the game was complete with all the enemies.

The game also got modernized in story elements as well, some things got streamlined and changed, most noted Ada got a section that more melds with her modern iterations of her, and Sherry's section is now more a puzzle mode in a band new area to the game. Overall it flexes but doesn't break the games known canon and is quite acceptable as it is.

The music of the classic resident evils have always been an important part of them, and this is one bit I feel the remake does fall flat on its face. The remakes' music blurs into the background and is extremely forgettable. If you have the original tracks dlc it feels a better even if a little tacked on, but kinda sucks you need to shell out $3 to fix this problem.

Overall this game kind of set a new standard for how remakes should be handled. I hope to see more remakes of this quality in the future, proper remakes instead of ports or ""HD"" upscales.",Recommended," March 12, 2019"

Resident Evil 2 is both terrifying and addictive as it can be.

The dead have risen, as fuzzy memories being brought back to life, and all the associated nightmares are now flooding back.
Nostalgia may entice old fans, but the entire experience in Resident Evil 2 is a brand new one that surprises from start to end.

The plot are almost brand new. Rookie cop Leon and college student Claire (sister of Chris Redfield); regardless of whose charecter you choose, there is little doubt that a feeling of dread is ever present in this new iteration of the infamous city. All the rain, dirt, grime, and blood permeates through the surfaces, and it is no coincidence that you will never feel quite safe. Something has gone terribly wrong, and you are living it with each and every tentative step you take.

Smart use of your limited resources, knowing when to fight and when to run, and preparing for upcoming encounters can be the difference between getting past a gauntlet of zombies, and staring at the ‚ÄúYou Are Dead‚Äù screens over and over again. Headshots no longer guarantee your safety, and the struggle intensifies when Mr. X decides to show up and ruin your day.

Of course, it would not be Resident Evil without some puzzles. From collecting chess pieces to opening ancient passageways with medallions, these are not exactly headscratchers, but they belong here in true Resident Evil fashion.

Seeing the gnarling jaws and slithering guts of the dead up close, one cannot help but admire the amount of work and dedication of the developers in making such a realistic representation of guts and gore, while simultaneously fearing for your life.

Resident Evil 2 is a perfect love letter to all the hardcore fans of the survival horror classic, and an impressive entry for newcomers to enjoy all that made the original so special. This is the definitive entry to represent survival horror, and Resident Evil 2 continues the course of making Resident Evil special again.

It's a fairly grounded horror story that becomes so much more, and it'd be a disservice to call it a remake in the first place.",Recommended, March 12

Resident Evil 2 is a near perfect remake full of impressive visuals, grotesque designs, sharp gunplay and a simple, effective plot. With only a couple of incredibly minor niggles such as a occasionally wooden scripting and performance taking the smallest amount of shine off an otherwise beautifully polished and restored piece of video game history, Capcom have proven that even an aged classic can meet modern expectations. Cannot wait for Resident Evil 3.

All told, Resident Evil 2 is an utterly fantastic remake, reimagining a 90‚Äôs classic for a modern audience with modern sensibilities. A single playthrough is slight at about 8-10 hours, but every minute is oozing with quality. If that‚Äôs enough for you there are also alternative routes with other characters, a couple of secret modes and some fairly crazy unlockables for those who absolutely master the game. Resident Evil 2 is a brilliant rendition of one of the finest survival horror experiences of all time.",Recommended, January 2

To give you context: I usually am not a huge fan of horror, especially ones that give you no tools to avoid or fight the monster, kind of like Slender Man. I also got into Resident Evil 4 first before trying this game.

To tell you, this is not one of those horror games. Sure, there may be jumpscares, but they're not so super in your face, and it's not an instant game over. You have the choice to fight back or run away (except one of the enemies, you absolutely have to run, at least he's slow).

This game is seriously amazing. Even if I haven't gotten to try out the originals back in my PS1 days, I assure you that this game has been treated with serious love and care from CAPCOM themselves, making them shout at other AAA companies what a REMAKE should actually mean. The controls we usually know from the Resident Evil 4 days have been improved so much, you can strafe, EVEN while aiming. It also goes to show that the tension we feel is also from resource management as well.

I finished Leon's campaign once, and started Claire's as of this writing. All I can say is that both of them are not the same, especially with the weapons they carry. You'll see sooner or later.

It's not often you can say that a title remake is probably the best instalment in a gaming franchise. In the case of Resident Evil 2, you can. It's actually a good contender for game of the year, even though its a remake, and that says a lot. Capcom reminded us that the true 3rd person survival horror genre isn't dead. It has exactly the right amount of nostalgia that hits you in the feels without capitalizing on it. It looks amazing from every aspect, definitely one of the best looking games to date. If I tried to imagine an ideal remake for Resident Evil 2 by today's standards, I wouldn't imagine something THIS good.

UPDATE: Apparently they removed Denuvo from the game. This is huge news and props to the developers for this. I love this game and company even more because of this pro move. Other companies should follow but their heads are up their asses.
Pros:
-Beautiful remake of the original RE 2
-Character models are amazing and pretty much fit their character
-Jumpscares and horrifying moments. Exactly what RE should have.
-Story is compelling and voice acting is great
-Alternate outfits are great
-When you take damage, the character shows the exact injuries you receive and their expressions are spot on from all the pain they have to muscle through.
-Story is somewhat rewritten so it isn't completely a copy of RE 2 which helps with old fans enjoying a new aspect.
-There are so many little things that RE 2 has that will just make you smile as a proud gamer. Shadows, lighting, sounds, and even some enemies reacting to your weapons.

Cons:
-No Claire booty outfit. Seriously tho.
-You can't run in this game. You can do a jog but it is like a morning jog where you enjoy your day and frolic through the grass

It's a good time to be a survival horror fan and a Resident Evil fan as well!

RESIDENT EVIL 2 captures the essence of the classic title and cranks it up to eleven on all fronts.

Fine Status
Resident Evil is survival horror once again:
enemies are slow, but still menacing and dangerous up close;
ammo is scarce, but weapons have weight and satisfying feedback;
there isn't much background music, but 3D sound and ambiance is used to build up the atmosphere;
features a fairly short story, but adds extra replayability value with unlocks;


The gunplay has a solid feel to it, despite enemies being major bullet sponges. It's not nearly as over the top as in the original, but still provides satisfying audiovisual feedback. Upon impact zombies flinch and have visible wounds, letting the player know that their attacks are connecting. Gunshots don't sound powerful, but instead weapons have moderate recoil, bright muzzle flash, while characters have smooth combat animations, making the gunplay experience feel better than in Resident Evil 7.

Popping heads is a welcome surprise, destruction of limbs enables a more tactical approach to combat, allowing the player to decide on the best course of action: shooting a weak spot for complete elimination, stunning the target and running past by them to save up on some precious ammo and time, shooting legs to slow an enemy down and make them less dangerous, shooting arms to prevent the infected from using doors. The choice is there, the rest depends on the player's preferences.

Enemy attack animations have appropriate weight to them. Claw swings actually produce visible distortion in the air just to highlight how deadly they are, if a claw hits a hard surface then it produces sparks and decals. Grabs play a big role of startling the player, so the camera goes for a dramatic zoom, while you get a nice look at the attacking enemy. Occasionally, the grabs are supposed to disorient the player, as the character can turn around while responding to the threat.

Self-defense item (sub-weapon) mechanic is reintroduced and it's your best friend:



You can't craft these (at least in the main game) and there aren't many available throughout the game, so it's a valuable and even powerful resource if you know when and how to use it. On a side note, self-defense items do not work if you're standing on stairs.

RE Engine's capabilities of rendering dense urban environments with impressive visual fidelity were a pleasant surprise. Before the first trailer hit the public, there was some concern about how the engine would hold up when going from first person in a rural area to third person in a city. In the end we got much better looking characters, new graphical features, no pre-cache stutter and a reasonable frame rate.

User experience when using the menus is great: everything is snappy and clean, every option has a simple explanation and everything is grouped properly. The interface experience is good even during gameplay, as one can do quick and precise inventory manipulations even without much practice. Another case of attention to detail is the fact that cutscenes do not contribute to in-game timer, so there's no need to skip them. As an example, RE6 chapter ranking system includes cutscene time along with gameplay time, penalizing players that enjoy slower-paced gameplay.

The experience of survival horror is enhanced by subtle sound effects and clever ambiance tracks. There's power even in ‚Äúsilence‚Äù, something that is predominant in Resident Evil 7 and inherited in RE2. Dynamic soundtrack is in place, changing from silence to tension, depending on enemy proximity and awareness. On the flip side, there aren't enough memorable tracks that stand out and leave the whole soundtrack being forgettable. That's something that can be remedied with Soundtrack Swap DLC, but it doesn't always blend in well enough due to soundtrack fades and timing, ending up feeling like a community mod. Ironically, the extra content has more memorable and catchy tracks than the whole main game. There are entries in the series that can pull off rich soundtrack, while retaining atmospheric ambiance and horror (see RE Revelations).

Having four scenarios ends up feeling like a late development decision. The differences between same character scenarios are fairly minimal: slightly different dialogue, guns and items. It adds a lot more replayability, but can end up being a little stale after a while. The fact that it was added to begin with was a major surprise to some, but the end result makes you wish that there was a bit more to it. Perhaps, Resident Evil 3 might fill that void?

The lack of Extreme Battle minigame, a predecessor of The Mercenaries is a missed opportunity. Extreme Battle offered a versatile approach of having multiple loadouts, difficulties and complete exploration of the game's areas with added randomization of items and enemies. Ghost Survivors follow similar footsteps of The 4th Survivor (a minigame which makes the player run past most enemies), while adding item and weapon pick-ups to the mix. Unfortunately, not everyone can enjoy this type of playstyle these minigames offer. On the other hand, the soundtrack featured in these modes stands out and Ghost Survivors has one scenario that is an exception to the rule, a scenario where you don't need to run away. In the end, since it's ‚Äúfree‚Äù, then we ‚Äúcan't complain‚Äù.

There are a bunch of reused assets scattered around the game: assets from Resident Evil 7, which can stand out a lot for players that went through RE7 a couple of times; repeating objects that end up being eyebrow raising if you notice their appearances throughout the game (and I don't mean zombies). It's a small nitpick, a common practice and, fortunately, the items in question blend in with the scenery well enough.

One negative thing about the game on a technical level is that the enemy animation frame rate is reduced if you're not within a particular distance. You can easily spot this behavior if you look at the enemies that are standing across a hall. This breaks the immersion and in-game options menu does not have anything that would disable this resource-saving trick.

PC release is a surprisingly well-made in-house version. The visual fidelity is higher than on consoles, options allow in-depth tweaking with useful descriptions and visual references. All visual settings are separated, so undesired effects can be toned down or turned off. As of now, RE2 has the most advanced tweaking available in a Resident Evil game, setting Capcom's quality bar for PC releases even higher. As an oddity, DX12 has a performance regression in comparison to DX11, so it's best to use the latter.

People are right: this game is not like the original Resident Evil 2, it is in its own league: a reimagined, modern take on Resident Evil 2, a completely different experience that stands on its own. With that in mind it's still worth playing both the 1998 original and the 2019 remake. If Resident Evil 3: Nemesis gets treated same way RE2 did, then it's going to be another exciting release.

Pros:

+ Making the game third person was a good move IMO. I don't like tank controls at all (Although I respect fixed camera angles).

+ Completely new puzzles and didn't re-use any from the original. Which makes this game a completely new game and not just a remake. More like a re-imagining.

+ New areas in the police station. The sewers and the are basically 100% original levels too.

+ Graphics. Easily one of the best looking games this generation.

+ Soundtrack. Mainly the Mr.X theme. The rest ranges from good to serviceable.

+ The police station is so well done. It connects together and flows really well.

+ The classic Resident Evil puzzles of seeing something you can't open then going forward and finding the thing you need so you go back, is ""back"" and it's better than ever, IMO even surpasses the original. It's not confusing, but it doesn't hold your hand. Really well done.

+ Zombies sometimes wake up after they went down which can lead to tension and stress when visiting old areas. At first I thought it was annoying but I liked it with time.

+ Atmosphere. It's one of the best in the business.

+ Scary. Does have a lot of intense moments with the combination of zombies and lickers being in the same room or lickers and Mr.X. You don't know if you should run from the zombies/Mr.X and get hit by the lickers or move quietly and risk being hit by zombies/Mr.X.

+ Making Mr.X more prominent than the original was a great choice. He is so awesome...... in a horrifying way.

+ Bullets leave holes in enemies and limbs can even be torn off.

+ Free DLC and Retro Skins.

+ I love what they did with Knives, Grenades and Flash Bangs. They are now a mix of the sub weapons of Resident Evil Remake and their normal uses in other games. You can still knife and throw grenades and flash bangs but if an enemy holds you, You can use it to escape without damage. If you use a knife you can still grab it if it isn't broken after you down the enemy. This is amazing.

+ A bunch of quality of life improvements like placing a red tick on an item after it is no more needed like opening all the doors for this key. Now you can throw them knowing you don't need it. Also rooms will now turn blue, from red, to signify that you collected all items within the room and finished it's puzzle. Although combining weapons and ammo in the inventory is missing which is not a quality of life

+ The idea of being able to shoot while moving, but for you to be accurate and do more damage your have to stay still and slow down your shots is genius. It's smooth unlike RE4 and RE5 but still scary unlike RE6 because you still need to stay still if you want to make shots count.

+ I like how they made the films actually useful. Before they would give you lore but honestly that's a lot of pain in the a** just for lore.



- I would have liked for there to have been a way to dispose of ""sleeping"" zombies, Like what Resident Evil Remake did. Burning the bodies so they don't come back. Even if it was in short supply.

- I wish zombies had normal swipe attacks and not just grabs. Feels cheep at times when you get grabbed and grabbed one after another, even if it's less often than grabs.

- Voice acting. It ranges from OK to so bad it's distracting and completely breaks the immersion. Except for Lieutenant Marvin Branagh. Claire tries too. Leon & Ada are bad though.

- The dialogue is meh. It's not terrible but it feels like a non native speaker wrote this, and this is coming from a non native speaker.

- Screen Space reflections are broken in this game, it gives these weird reflections that change with the characters movement, Only happens in main lobby though. And the game lacks MSAA Anti-Aliasing (best anti-aliasing for less edges with minimal input lag).

- This game does change some of the characters from the original, Like making Leon more naive and the chief less deceiving. Some people like it, some people don't.

- Zapping system is gone. You can't pick and choose between items and leave the rest for your second run like in the original.

- Leon and Claire didn't speak to each other a lot and only met 3 times from beginning to end and only in cutscenes. I miss this from the original where they met in person 3 times and talked a lot on the radio to give each other updates and requests giving a feeling of a co-operative experience. The remake did try replicating this with notes lying around from the other character in your second run but it doesn't really work.

- There are contradictions and inconsistencies between your first run (A) and your second (B). For example, In (B) you go around doing a lot of the same puzzles that the other character should have done in (A). I can excuse this since they have to use the same place and without puzzles you would just walk through the game, (even though the original did have some playthrough specific puzzles), Though it is different enough, with different enemy placements, guns, items box locations, rooms (since you get a different key than the other character which opens different rooms but the original had more different rooms) and Mr.X is changed a bit that it feels like a twist on the experience. I can excuse gameplay contradictions for the reasons I explained above. The original had the same problem, It still stings though. Story and cutscene inconsistencies and contradictions are another things though, For example:

1) The first and second boss for both playthroughs are the exact same boss and they enter and leave the room the same way (by distroying a path and then that path gets repaired the second playthrough to be destroyed again)

2) Apparently, [s]Annet Berkins[/s] dies 2 times, 1 in each playthrough in the same cutscene.

3) Sherry isn't seen in Leon's playthrough.

4) There isn't any moment like in the original where when you play the second playthrough some things start to make sense like how the [s]helecopter crashed[/s] or how the other character was there when this happened and stuff like that.

5) Doorways and pathways are locked and destroyed in one playthrough but is repaired magically when playing with the other character.

6) Little details are missing like the train being their for both playthroughs, even though the other character just used it. In the original, you had to call the train in the second playthrough.

I just wish there were subtle changes to hint that another person was here, Like how you can block windows for the other character in the original game. Of course, Completely new places and puzzles to do for the second character would have been fantastic. Even though the original didn't have it, The remake was a chance for the developers to change it and it's not an excuse.


- Bossfights are the same stuff over and over, Melee brutes that swipe at you and you have to run and shoot. Wish there had been more variety in the bosses (In the bosses them selves as in another person/stage of transformation and in the way it is defeated). The original did change it up more by giving different bosses to the different characters.

- Some Costumes and 3 guns are locked behind pre order bonuses and paid DLCs.


This is one of the best resident evil titles, definitely in my top 3 and definitely a GOTY contender. The biggest downfall of this game is the contradictions in the story and cutscenes between the characters.

Resident Evil 2 from PS1 was one of my favorite game ever since i had 8 years old.
Since this day, Resident Evil came to my life and it's been my favorite license of Video Games ever.

After Code Veronica i was dissapointed by the wrong Action turn of Capcom (even if i liked RE 4).

But today i forgive them ! Capcom is back with this awesome pure remake and i'm so happy by all the impressive works they made.The game is what all fans wanted since Resident Evil 5 & 6 : A real return to the Survival Horror roots

- The graphics,the athmosphere, the zombies ! woww it's unbelievable ! This remake is so much better than the original they worked on every details to make you feel how to be scared ! it's more dark and deeper than the first version from 1998.

- Claire and Leon are perfect now they're like the original but realistic !

- The zombies are the best ever seen in video games, they looks like real zombies and that's so dope !

Thank you Capcom for finally listening your fans after all theses years and decided to make it ! but i thank first the fans develloper (Invader Studio) who made this possible ! Without guys we would have never have this remake today (i guess)for those who don't know : in 2015 they made a fan version of Resident Evil 2 with their own way.
After this Capcom was curious when they saw what they made and they finally decided to work with them .

Leon the husbando

In this age of remakes Capcom finally jumped the remake train and remade Resident Evil 2 which is a real classic. I remember playing it as a kid, this was the first game of that type, it took me maybe 20 or 25 hours to complete it. Everything felt new and fresh back then for me and even without knowing english the experience was amazing. So how's the remake? Well, in short that's how remakes should be done, but it's not perfect.

There's probably no point talking about the story. Everyone already knows it. A cheesy, pretty simple but at the same time very entertaining. If there would be more cut-scenes (and I think this game lacks cut-scenes badly) it would be like one of those old cheesy action movies.

So what are the big changes? This is not a 1:1 remake with improved graphics, this is a whole new game. First thing it is now a third person game which leads to different gameplay mechanics. In the original you couldn't aim, accuracy was pure rng but when you hit that headshot it was satisfying and you were happy being able to save some bullets. Now obviously you can shoot zombies in the heads whenever you like, especially on PC with a mouse it's extremely easy. But zombies don't die from headshots here, unless you shoot them a lot of times ranging from couple of shots to ~10. But that's a good decision, wouldn't be fun killing every zombie with one shot, especially lickers. Instead developers thought of another great way to make your way through zombies ‚Äì you can shoot their limbs, that requires only 2-3 shots mostly and without a leg they can't walk so it's easy to avoid them when they're crawling. And it's so satisfying to shoot off all the limbs, their arms and legs fly off. Great sight.

There's of course the good old police station to explore. Everything is different but familiar at the same time. You explore, solve some puzzles, unlock doors and shortcuts. But then mister-x shows up and starts chasing you. I really hate this. I didn't encounter him in original game, I played only A story and there's no mister-x in it. It was fun taking your time and exploring everything, now you're forced to rush through the game. There are mods which could render mister-x harmless or you could use cheats DLC to get infinite weapons and stagger him each time you run into him. Still i'd prefer to not have him in A scenario just like in the original RE2.
There are other changes and they're disappointing. One of the most scary place for me was sewers where I met spiders. There's no spiders in this game. There's also no moths, cockroaches and crows. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing crows scared me back then I almost ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• my pants.
Inventory management is pretty much the same. While progressing through the game you unlock more space but I hate this stupid inventory. Why the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• a shotgun or huge pliers take same a mount of space as one key? All keys should fit into one slot. I can't stand this.

Graphically this game looks amazing. I really love the new Capcom engine, I hope to see more games on that engine. It runs great, scales well on different PC's, could run on potato. Max graphics look stunning and it performs very well. Game runs on 90-120fps for me on 3440x1440. It's rare to see a game so well optimized.
Environments look realistic, every area is highly detailed. Lighting is good but the game has that wash out feel, don't know why.
Character models are fenomenal. Face animations are great too, watching cut-scenes is a joy. And I must admit even though i'm straight but Leon looks hot as hell, should be a joy to play as Leon for female players. On the other hand Clair is good looking too, but Ada steals the crown fro male audience.
Overall graphically this is one of the best looking game today.

Sound is pretty good but in my opinion it doesn't come close in quality to graphics. It's fine, but nothing special. Music or ambient sounds are not too scary. It lacks that scary music and sounds which adds another layer of fear to the game.

This is a good remake but I didn't feel the same as playing the original. Probably because I already knew what to expect, there wasn't any moments of surprise. But I can't really blame the game here.
It has some replayability value. Leon and Clair playthroughs are quite different, there's even some sections and locations exclusively available only on one or the other playthrough.

A good game for horror fans, don't expect anything super scary, if you haven't played the original this might leave you more impressed but even if you played it it's still good. Definitely worth getting on sale.",Recommended, April 7

Alright, so I've played this game on higher difficulties (I am a masochist, what can I say) for about 88 hours, give or take. I feel like that's enough for me to give you an informed take on this title. I'm going to sum it up quickly: the experience is expensive, but VERY high quality and is everything a remake of a beloved game should be. There are a few cons, but they did not interfere with my immersion or enjoyment whatsoever during my various playthroughs.

Pros:
-The graphics are blindingly shiny
-Zombie design and world building are true-to-form, and definitely add to the intense dread
-Actually caused me extreme anxiety and tension, and I typically have little to no reaction to horror games or movies whatsoever (especially zombies)
-Faithful to the original while adding new mechanics that don't simply rely on frustrating you into being scared like the original, for example; keeps the IP integrity minty fresh
-The atmosphere and AI were insane amounts of fun in tandem, and I was fully and completely immersed in the Raccoon City police department
-The cutscenes were truly a treat, and had my nostalgic 90s kid self squealing against my will. I began to feel the way about Leon, Claire and Ava that weebs do about their 2d waifus. That part scared me the most, really. The fact that this game gave me a straight up dark night of the soul is enough for me to encourage everyone to try it. I may be slightly exaggerating...but maybe not. I haven't decided yet. Ask me again when I get my Leon Kennedy love doll in the mail. Also, I need money to buy a love doll. Venmo me like 8k so my review has more weight to it.
-The animations when you get chomped on are great
-Voice acting gave new life to familiar faces
-Not too much or too little ammo on the A story on normal mode, but I highly suggest it for noobs to the series: on higher difficulties, you will need to utilize my strategy of simply blowing off the limbs of all the zombies instead of gambling on head shot crits and dumping ammo into it. For one, it is highly efficient. Two, it is f*cking hilarious. I see a lot of people are not familiar with that randomized mechanic and are upset their 360 no scope headshot didn't instantly kill everything in sight. There is literally nothing scary about zombie games for that exact reason, so I am mystified by this ire. It's not as though it isn't directly related to the story or anything. Why am I even being sarcastic right now? Who am I even talking to? I'm sorry for yelling.

Cons:
-Cutscenes are too infrequent, and without giving any spoilers - rather abrupt and lackluster at the end. Perhaps there were alternate endings I hadn't got as I had intentionally meandered as slowly as I could through each part of the game. If so, do let me know! I would love to take this outta my list of complaints.
-There is some mild repetition with the zombie models that probably could have been avoided, but it's not *too* noticeable like in games such as Dying Light. It's so very minimal, which is why I wondered why it happened at all, really. Not a big deal, though.
-The Mr. X sequence is more of an annoying nuisance, instead of garnering suspense. It was the only part of the game where I remembered I was, in fact, actively playing a video game. For those too young to remember the original or have not played it, the Mr. X (or Tyrant, as I believe he is called in this incarnation) chase sequence was part of the ""B Story"" mode. I didn't enjoy it being part of the main story, and found it tedious and distracting.

Even with my headphones and 3d sound, unless his footfalls are VERY close, the sound kind of seemed arbitrary. I did not really understand his spawning pattern, and it just caused me to do a lot of standing and waiting for him to p*ss off when I was low on healing items. Meh. It's a huge waste of ammo to shoot him, so sometimes I'd just let him punch me in the face to get on with it when he'd occasionally find/trap me. It's not *hard* or anything, it's just not that fun (in my opinion).
-No side quests or new areas (aside from the orphanage segment*)
-Not enough notes and whatnot lying around for you to pick up and read - one of my favorite parts of these games minimized a bit too much - we still appreciate story & atmospheric items, devs! <3
-Kinda half-a**ed ""B-Story"" compared to the original, which basically giving you a whole new game to play around with
-Not enough secrets for my liking, and believe me - I LOOKED. It's technically a mini-open world as you can wander about as you please, but it still is forcibly linear progression with little deviation. So long as you are aware of that, you're going to have a fantastic time inside of the story. It doesn't have any crazy RPG decision trees or anything, which I'm fine with either way.
-Story about the virus and the former survivors was actually pretty sparse given how wide this universe is after all these years, but I am nitpicking quite a bit. It was a safer option to go with what worked with the original, for sure. I'm glad a new generation gets to be terrified by this excellent game. :3

So, there you have it. While there are a few things here or there that I certainly took note of, I could not recommend this title enough. I definitely got my money's worth, and so will you. Some of my more squeamish friends became so terrified and stressed out by this game, they can't even play it. That's a beautiful thing!

Whenever you are a complete newcomer to the old school survival horror formula and want a taste of this beloved genre, have some level of experience with recent horror titles from the indie lot, or are a veteran who has Spencer Mansion and the Silent Hill roads mapped in his head, Resident Evil 2 Remake is a title that can't be ignored and deserves every bit of praise it got.

63 hours behind in this, so I'm pretty qualified to give my feedback for this.

It's been a long wait for all of the Resident Evil fans to finally experience a modern take on the classic that is RE2. And boy did Capcom surpass every single expectation there was.

The game is a masterclass AAA-title, where they fusioned elements of the original game into modern presentation, and took liberties when adding/removing/altering certain elements. That combination works flawlessly and brought us one of the best, if not the best, game of 2019. Every single detail is carefully balanced to make the game addictive, challenging and fresh. RE Engine is definitely one of the best game engines out there right now, game is graphically beautiful, well detailed and has amazing amount of little details, especially when it comes to the enemy animations and effects. Sound department has also outdone themselves, game is filled with fantastic sound effects, that lift up the atmosphere and suspense into very intense levels. Sound mix is also professional work, as is the score. Score itself is pretty radical departure compared to the original's memorable tunes, but the new score definitely has some amazing pieces of compositions, and is by no means bad score, it fits the game perfectly and is modern. Legendary R.P.D has given a modern overhaul and Capcom took liberties in redesigning certain elements to suit the modern presentation better and to make the station feel a bit more realistic. I felt that after the R.P.D, the maps were not that incredible, especially the labs felt pretty bland in comparison, hardly any rooms to explore despite lab being huge.

Game story wise isn't nothing special compared to other RE-titles, it has that B-movie charm to it, yet, doesn't go into cheesy-section too much. Overall tone of the game's setting is much more serious compared to the original. Capcom also went all out with the gore, providing one of the most detailed gore effects in games.

When it comes to the enemies, zombies in this game are truly scary, they haven't been scary in many games for years and it's notable how well Capcom managed to design the gameplay and zombies so that you are really scared of them and they are dangerous enemies always. When it comes to the other enemies, I feel that dogs are rather disappointing enemies, not providing hardy any threat to player. Lickers on the other hand, are dangerous, if you don't know how to approach them. Bosses themselves are pretty straightforward stuff, I never felt that they are truly dangerous and beating them wasn't anything difficult after all, all of the boss battles basically had pretty obvious hints of how to take them out. Redesigned Ivy-creatures on the other hand are probably one of the best and scariest monster designs in the whole franchise, frightening and very dangerous, Capcom really delivered with those.

Then, we come to the enemy that has stirred the fans and players alike, of how Capcom designed the gameplay with him:

Mr.X

Unlike in the original, where he only appeared on scripted moments and rewarded you with some goodies after you downed him, here he is like the Terminator of Raccoon City. He seeks you all over the R.P.D, never giving up on the search/hunt. Capcom made a ballsy move when they decided to make him invincible, only having the option to down him for a while. X's design approach clearly was that once you've searched all over the R.P.D and killed most of the enemies, you would have too easy time over there and it would be also pretty boring to run around in a empty police station. So having this one invincible enemy running after you stirs up the gameplay suspense into second phase. Clever, but also somewhat predictable design choise, Capcom didn't want players to feel too comfortable in the game. However, X is only seeking you when you're in the R.P.D, after that he only appears on couple scripted moments.

Still, Mr.X is definitely one of the most memorable game enemies of this current generation, and will stay in our memories for sure.

A great remake of a great game and a worthy addition for the Remake Age of gaming we're currently living in.

I still remember most of the original from 1998 and if we're nitpicking I could list a lot of differences. But this is a remake, a reimagining for a modern age (naysayers just might call this dumbing down) and Capcom did an excellent job. A remake for the textbooks. It seems Capcom took all the best bits from various Resident Evil games and mashed them all together into one giant, savory and tasty sweet potato mash.

The visuals are top notch. The new RE Engine works wonders, scales well with options, is incredibly well optimized (I've had absolutely no technical issues with the game, not a single bug or a glitch, played on i7-7700, RTX2070, 32GB RAM and an SSD) and breathes life into the characters, monsters and human, and environments which are now packed with details. From sewers full of garbage and subtle writing on the chalkboards to the horribly gazing and blinking eyes on the G Monster. Lighting deserves a special mention and really brings the tension in. Characters are highly polished, move and act like normal human beings (still in the uncanny valley, no doubt there, but they're very well done) and facial animations are great.

Audio, ambient sounds and voices are impeccably done, but there's that little something missing about the music. It lacks those fear inducing strings that the original had for an added layer of stress.

Gameplay mechanics are updated for the new generations and they're brilliant. The characters are not pieces of concrete slab on wheels, but move and respond with brisk pace. The aiming mechanics are improved, meaning you can actually aim (you couldn't in the original) which makes applying excessive high velocity blunt trauma to zombies very satisfying. Don't expect them to go down quickly though. With the improved aiming come improved, resilient zombie bullet sponges. They can absorb a lot, even on the easiest difficulty, but shooting them in the arms and legs takes them off, leaving them armless or crawling and making them easier to avoid. The inventory management is pretty much the same, fiddly with limited item slots that are upgradeable with inventory bags, if you find them. Each character has different weapons that can be fitted with modifications, but some of them increase the space the weapon occupies in the inventory. The bizzare puzzles with door hunting, jeweled boxes, weird keys and lost medallions are still here, but are not a large hindrance to progress. Everything is clearly marked and written, just open your eyes. Mr. X, a greyish terminator wannabe, pops out at inopportune moments making your life a bit more stressfull and cementing his echoey footsteps in your mind. He can be brought down temporarily, but at great cost to your inventory, if you have it to begin with. Easier to run and find another path. The Lickers are still the scariest product of Resident Evil's minds.

There are 2 main stories, Leon and Claire. Finishing them opens up the 2nd run stories, which are slightly different with different main item placements. There's also an unlockable 3rd story (absolutely worth it to finish this just for the bonuses you get) after doing the main ones. The story itself is ok, it's satisfying, it's fun to follow, but it's not any kind of remarkable accomplishment. The entire Resident Evil story is pretty much a convoluted mess. To quote one character from the game, ""Nothing dies down here"". It's well worth finishing both normal stories and second runs, they're different enough and you'll get a few new angles on the story. And the game is made to be played multiple times. As you learn the map layouts and key item placements, and you'll need that knowledge if you're planning to finish the stories with an S rank, you'll see your game completion times go down. There are 3 difficulty modes, Assisted (which makes the game rather easy even if you have no experience), Standard (normal mode) and Hardcore. Hardcore features significant changes. There's no autosave, you need to find ink ribbons to be able to save normally and the enemies are tougher. But even hardcore shouldn't be much of an issue when you're armed with knowledge from your past runs.

A free DLC, Ghost Survivors, was added to the game, adding 4 new what if stories featuring some side characters from the main game. They're somewhat short runs, slightly more action oriented get from point A to point B, but are fun and each one adds a different obstacle, like exploding poison zombies.

A great survival horror game, slightly toned down on the horror, but updated for a faster, modern age with slick visuals and controls, still retaining everything that made the original such a remarkable game. Well worth a play and if you've waited this long to get it, you can find it rather often on a great discount, putting the price around ‚Ç¨20.

Take a peek inside the newly opened if you like to walk off the beaten path and only sometimes return to the main roads. You might find something worth exploring. And if you do, thank you for the visit.

: There's a few collectible achievements, a few missables (defeat a boss with x timer left, finish the game without opening an item box and a few more) and 2 hardcore/speedrun achievements (they can be combined, if you're good). I can't judge how hard the speedruns are going to be for you (as of writing, I've done the Assisted speedrun as a test run in around 2 hours 30 minutes and I've done Claire's story on Hardcore), that depends on your patience and willingness to learn the layout of the game, but they're not super easy and if speedrunning's not your thing, the S rank times might be cutting it close. Everything in the normal game can be done on Assisted difficulty which makes the game a much more casual stroll, but speedruns need to be done on Standard or Hardcore. The 4th Survivor extra story and No Way Out from The Ghost Survivors are rather tough and will definitely need a few tries, even if you check a video walkthrough.

Update (22/4/2020): Done Leon's A story, Standard difficulty, S+. It's not Hardcore, but it's doable and it's enough for the achievement.",Recommended, April 22

In 1998 I was 13 years old, already a big fan of the original Resident Evil. But when Resident Evil 2 came out... it took everything that I loved from the original and amped to another level. In the same regard, how the movie Aliens elevated the Alien franchise to another level, Resident Evil 2 was very similar. Resident Evil 2 was a survival horror game I wasn't ready to play. It was so terrifying I had to turn the game off. The atmosphere, graphics, sound design and story was ahead of it's time. A blueprint of what a true survival horror game should be.

After many years hoping to return and relive the darkness of Resident Evil 2, the remake is finally here!

I'm 34 now, but still carry the 13 year old boy with me and as I walk through the dark corridors of Raccoon City. This is where true evil lives. RE2 remake has amazing graphics, acting, atmosphere and new content to make it a new masterpiece. If you are a Resident Evil fan this is an instant buy. My only gripe I had was at times it's overly dark and washed out visuals, I expected a much more vivid RE2 remake. Do not fear though, the game is still gorgeous and a true action horror adventure.

I played the original in 1998 and for that day it was a awesome survival horror, Capcom doing what they do best. Then we got Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS this was good and if not was better then 2. Later we got Resident Evil 4 also another good title, then they kinda dropped from the tight, enclosures and went with Resident Evil 5, then 6 all duck and cover combat, and then finally 7 < started to return to its roots but not quiet there. Then they release Resident Evil 2 Remake and boy was the wait worth it, from the first day they announced it and then hearing nothing for what seemed like an eternity, gameplay a release date and a playable demo arrived and as before, boy was it worth it. Many times fans alike have begged Capcom for a remake and yet it went unheard and then finally they listened and made a masterpiece from the ground up to show us all what they can and will do. Me like many are now wondering after all the remasters of there old Resident Evil game and one full remake, what can we expect next, well like me I am hopeing for a Resident Evil 3 NEMESIS and Dino Crisis to be next. But I suppose we will have to see if Resident Evil 2 hits the sale targets.
Final note: This game is gorgeous, runs lovely and scares the **** out of you. This is Capcom at there best, so I for one hope they do read peoples reviews and take all we say onboard. Well done Capcom.

That‚Äôs where Resident Evil succeeds... Not in the drivel spouted from its character‚Äôs mouths,, but in the bullets spewed from their guns.. Or better yet ‚Äìthe clicking of empty chambers or the spine-chilling scratches of scrabbling overhead... I may hate lickers, but Im also a little bit in love<3

Whether you‚Äôre a long time fan or a newcomer,, Resident Evil 2 remake is an absolutely fantastic game! Its the best in the series yet and wholly outshined my most optimistic expectations... It doesnt supersede the original, but its an excellent retelling,, a wonderful update, and an excellent experience.....",Recommended," December 21, 2019"

I think I'm not the only one when I say that my favourite part of the classic series is Resident Evil 2. The main reason is probably the fact that it took place in an urban environment for a change instead of the usual creepy manor, although we only get to spend a minor portion of the game outdoors, since the police station is basically the redesigned version of the mansion from the first part (unfortunately I've never played the 3rd part which also takes place in Raccoon City and has much more city landscape in it). So when Capcom announced the remake of Resident Evil 2 after the release of Resident Evil 0, I was obviously excited.

On his first day of duty, a police officer, Leon S. Kennedy finds Raccoon City overrun by living dead. After meeting Claire Redfield (we can also play as her), sister of one of the protagonists of the first game, he finds the local police station deserted and almost all police officers dead. Joining forces with a mysterious female agent he makes his way to the underground laboratories of the pharmaceutical company Umbrella, where he discovers the source of the problems.

Fortunately Capcom realized that was a mistake, so the only thing the game retained from it, was its engine.
Despite the improvements the game is still the same old survival-horror with slight adventure elements we remember of: provided with scarce amounts of ammunition we must get past enemies, combine and use items to solve puzzles and engage powerful bosses (these fights cannot be avoided) who tend to return in a more powerful form from time to time.
The atmosphere is even better than it was, fighting zombies in the dark corridors of the police station is scarier than ever, thanks to the great lighting effects and the shadows. The original was quite gruesome already, but this time - mainly due to the detailed visuals - it's often utterly disgusting. Zombies take damage to their certain bodyparts and lose limbs accordingly (strangely enough it applies to zombies only, so shooting a licker in the leg will not immobilize it) in the bloodiest way imaginable. They chase us through doors and the only secure place from them are the 'safe rooms' with the typewriters (used for saving our progress).
One of the new things is bringing back the use of defensive items from . Once we are grabbed by a foe, the only way to escape is to use one of these special items, such as knives, flash- and hand grenades. What's worse, knives can no longer be used infinitely anymore to take out downed zombies, they'll break eventually. It's important to note, that these defensive items can be used actively with greater efficiency, so if we use a flash grenade to escape the clutches of a zombie it will stun that single one and no one else, while throwing it actively it'll daze an entire room of enemies.
Weapons can be upgraded (although some of them doesn't seem to do much) and we can also mix gunpowder (?) to create bullets/shells, similar to the well-known different coloured herbs.

To my surprise instead of the old fixed camera perspective the game uses 3rd person over the shoulder view, which makes the game much more playable and immersive. Finally, unlike in the 4th and 5th installment we are now able to move AND fire at the same time. Even with this 'feature' we are going to feel overwhelmed against our opponents: even the slowest zombies are basically faster than us and our basic pistols are weaker than ever. Shooting enemies in the head is no easy task: it bobbles and they love to charge at us in zig-zags, not to mention that critical hits are very rare (Wesker's pistol seems to have a higher chance). Aiming at the legs seems to be the solution once again, since now we can even dismember zombies (just like in ).



The characters are great and so are the dialogues, there's no trace of the terrible and awkward conversations present in the original. Leon is probably the easiest for anyone to identify themselves with in the Resident Evil universe: he is not a super agent (yet, haha), just a simple cop on his first day. Regardless of this, the story is still at the level of an average B movie, but that's just how Resident Evil is.
Leon and Claire have slightly different campaigns and I must say I was disappointed with the number of differences: 95% of the gameplay is the same, there are only about 2 rooms and areas which are only available for one of them and vice versa, the same applies to the bosses. The solution of the puzzles are slightly modified and the weapons they find are completely different (as usual, the female protagonist, Claire gets to use the more powerful weaponry - a grenade launcher and a submachinegun).
Another difference is between the 2 subscenarios, in Leon's case we control Ada, while with Claire we play as Sherry, a little girl. Both of these are about 10-10 minutes long so it doesn't provide much variety either. Because of this, playing the game through the second time with a different character feels a bit boring. There are some additional scenarios after we beat the game, but these are more like timed runs with supporting characters that add nothing to the plot.



While the graphics seem amazing, some elements, especially the textures on some objects show signs of fluctuating quality: the cars in the garage under the police station look very bad, no matter how high we set the graphics detail. The hair of the characters looks nowhere near as good as it does in . I must emphasize that the game has excellent visuals, but the contrast between a few things is noticeable. Also, if we don't set the shadow quality to high, there'll be observable stripes on the walls. In my opinion the graphics in were better, except for facial animations.
The sound design is amazing, for me it was one of the best parts of the game. I like the new music, but I must admit the old one is the real deal (even if it's too loud at times even on low volume), which we can purchase as a DLC (it's included in the deluxe edition).

I was surprised that the game offers no co-op gameplay mode. For some reason I thought Capcom wouldn't release it without some form of multiplayer. This game just begs for a co-op mode.
Storywise some parts were changed, for example the role of the police chief and for the worse unfortunately. We can only meet the mayor's daughter in an expansion scenario.
I also had some problems with the flashlight which Leon/Claire turns on/off automatically, sometimes even when being in pitch black areas. Inventory management is terrible, yet still better than in any of the classic games and this time it's at least expandable.

Capcom has made an amazing remake of an already great game that every Resident Evil - horror fan should play. It's a shame for some missed opportunities and flaws. The game provides plenty of fun, if we decide to play through all 4 (although quite similar) alternative paths and the timed runs. For me this game is right there along with as the best ones in the franchise.

PROS
+ the excellent atmosphere of the original
+ over the shoulder view
+ even scarier than the classic RE games
+ great visuals
+ superb audio
+ additional subscenarios

CONS
- very similar paths with some illogical elements
- some parts of the story are not as detailed as they were in the original
- some minor technical problems
- (absence of co-op mode)

EA ""single player games are dead""

""Resident Evil 2 Remake Sells 3 million copies its first week"" (to overwhelmingly positive response, with no gold editions or season passes or micro-transactions) how they are called ""micro"" anymore when the ""coin"" packs can be up to twice the price of the original game is baffling.

EA & Activision this is how you make a game for gamers, capcom will be around long after countries ban your money making gambling loot boxes aimed specifically at CHILDREN have been destroyed, and you're company's will be nothing but a digital gravestone that people will p*ss on for many years to come so that future publishers will never EVER forget.

Capcom continue to rise from the ashes with another brilliant game this is how a company redeems itself First Was Resident Evil VII, Then Resident Evil II: Remake, Devil May Cry V, and with Resident Evil III: Nemesis & Resident Evil VIII on the horizon the future is looking amazing for Capcom and Resident Evil Fans.

Go Bankrupt EA & Activision and let the people that rise from the ashes have a new outlook on how to make great games for the gamer again instead of f*cking shareholders and creating gambling addicts among children and feeding adults already massive gambling addictions. you despicable animal parasites.

Resident Evil 3: Nemesis feels like a cash grab $93 AUD for a game that's 1h 45m in length with the vast majority of content cut out of the game that was in the original... i have serious reservations about Resident Evil Village & Resident Evil 4 Remake while i never liked it myself i expect the game to be at least as long if not longer than the original vision and if its not they can kiss goodbye to all the amazing reception to their games they have had with Resident Evil VII, Resident Evil 2 & Devil May Cry 5.",Recommended," January 27, 2019"

This is the zombie game I've always hoped for. My expectations were very high, but this game exceeds. It blends the true survival horror feeling of the original games with the updated over-the-shoulder perspective of the modern games. With this and RE7 back-to-back, it looks as if Capcom is back on form. Hopefully, the success of this means we'll see an RE3 remake in a similar vein at some point in the near future.

They did it. In Resident Evil 2, horror has a new, yet familiar visage. The virus outbreak/zombie apocalypse theme may have been done to death at this point, but if someone was entitled to resurrect it, that would be the company that popularised survival horror 2 decades ago. And as they had our undivided attention back then, they have it once again in 2019.

So far the best game of 2019. Coming all the way back from the Sony Playstation era everyone should know about the Resident Evil series, especially the two originals RE1 from 1996 and its excellent sequel RE2 from 1998.
For years fans have asked for a remake in the similar veins as the one on the GameCube called REmake but we have been left in the cold until now.
So the Resident Evil 2 Remake is finally here across all platforms and let me tell you it is glorious. It runs on the excellent RE engine which powered RE7 before and has some excellent graphics properties on the PC running all the way up to 4K of course.
Graphics and sounddesign is excellent. The soundtrack on the other hand isnt as memorable as the original 1998 version was but as a bonus you can switch to the classic soundtrack via DLC if you suffer from nostalgia like myself.
All dialogue and characters have been updated to realistic standards and excellent facial animation conveys the story believable. Sure I still miss the the old campy feel like Ada leaving Leon behind ""Ada wait"" but overall its great to see the classic updated with such high fidelity.

Pro:
- Great visuals and facial animations and physics
- PC version is designed properly and offers a lot of graphics options
- Terrific 3D sound design, have to play this with headphones
- Enough content to keep you busy
- Mister X himself...

Contra:
- New soundtrack isnt on par with its original version but can be swapped via DLC
- Characters seem a little bit more flat than their corny originals (Ben was way more likeable in the classic)
- Leons and Claires B scenarios arent as diverse as the original campaigns which felt different, here they seem just a little bit harder from the main scenarios

Overall an excellent game with lots of content and definitely one you want to play even if you dislike the survival horror genre this is a must play. 9 kisses from Ada out of 10!",Recommended," February 10, 2019"

Unlike the fixed cameras in the old game, this one features ‚Äúover the shoulder‚Äù point of view, similar to Resident Evil 4, and to be honest, it was the right thing to do. It modernizes the gameplay, while still maintaining the horror aspect that the old game had. As for the gameplay, the controls are quite responsive and easy to learn. Also, unlike the previous games, whenever you kill an enemy, its corpse will remain on the ground right where you shot it. However, whenever you down a zombie, you can‚Äôt really tell if it‚Äôs dead or not unless you hit it once more and see if it reacts. There are no ‚Äúblood pools‚Äù to indicate if a zombie is dead or not, and it only furthers up the horror element of the game. Also, whenever you hit an enemy, the blood will splatter around, which is so gory to watch. Depending on where you hit them, you can remove some of the limbs of the zombies, thus reducing the threat they pose.",Recommended," May 14, 2019"

I felt right at home playing this game. Resident Evil 2 Remake continues to confirm my love of the series as it showcases some of the best of its formula which includes outstanding level design, incredible immersive atmosphere which puts you right in the mood, fun puzzles, tense combat, exciting exploration, the list goes on. The game hooks you by making you uncover each area of the game room by room which always makes you eager to see if you're going to get more ammo that you desperately need or an upgrade to your gun or a key that will help you unlock more rooms. The story is simple but engaging and the characters are likeable. One complaint i have is scenario B's events play out almost identical to your first playthrough so the continuity isn't there like a character dying twice in two different ways or both Leon and Claire fighting the same bosses and killing them the same way etc. it's annoying because the original game didn't have this problem, the two perspectives overlapped perfectly but in the remake it just doesn't make any sense. Aside from that though this is one of the best Resident Evil games and a must play even if you're new to the series.

Where do I start? GAME OF YEAR award for 2019, it came out fighting and was the remake of all remakes that I honestly think no one was expecting. This is how it should be done. Let's get to it, I'll start with the fact that I played the original game in on the og PlayStation 1, yes tanks controls are awesome ;-) This remake pulls the game from the dead =) and gives it newer life and boy did it meet my overall expectation! I honestly had jump scares while playing the game for about the first half a dozen times for multi plays. The game-play, replayability, graphics, new twist on the story line are this games strong points. Though it has its flaws they are small , and can be overlooked. With that being said be TACTICAL, mindful of your surroundings in the game, listen, look, observe, and conserve ammo when need be.

One of the best horror games I have ever played.

A must have for fans of the horror genre!
In short, it's brilliant!

What is Resident Evil 2 (2019)?
It is a remake of a 1998 classic, Resident Evil 2, and it takes place two months after
the events of the first Resident Evil.
It is also a third-person survival horror game where you have to manage your inventory very
carefully. No. It isn't as action oriented as Resident Evil 6.
In Resident Evil 2 you walk around a post apocalyptic Raccoon City in where you have to
scavenge for weapons, ammunition and health items.
Different types of plants lay around the city and you can combine them to create either
antitoxins or items that replenish your health. Monsters can take lots of bullets and ammo
is scarce so you have to pick your shots and fighting may not always be the best option.
Sometimes you just got to use those little legs of yours and run.
You also have to backtrack in this game A LOT.
Sometimes you get to a new area just to get a key or another important item and then go
back to a previous area, unlock a door, get another item and then go back the way you just
came from. It may sound like it can get repetitive but it really doesn't.
The game progresses nicely and always throws something new and interesting at you.

What about the story? It has quite a simple story.
You play as two different characters: A rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy on his first day
at the job and as a college student Claire Redfield who is trying to find her brother, Chris.
Claire and Leon are both heading to Raccoon City but once they get there they discover that
the entire city has been overrun by monsters.
Escaping from the city becomes their new objective but both get a different reason to dwell
even further into the abyss.
They both get a separate single-player campaign and you have to play through both to get
a """" ending.

Resident Evil 2 takes us back to the good old days of getting rewarded for playing the
game and doing challenges. You can unlock different outfits, concept art
and new game modes adding more replay value to the game.
There are also three upcoming story DLCs in the works.

Resident Evil 2 is beautiful to look at. It is dark, creepy, addicting and super fun.
It's just a brilliant title. Absolutely brilliant!
This might be one of the best games of 2019 but it's too early to say.
We are on to a good start.",Recommended," February 5, 2019"

The game is AWESOME! For real, this is what all of fans had waited for! It is when an old game wrapped in a new, beautiful cover gives a great feelings of returning to your childhood. 2 stories to choose, 2 charming heroes - Leon and Claire, still young and naive, are once again plunging into the zombie epidemic of Raccoon City. You will visit these familiar locations - the police station, sewer area and, of course, the most secret laboratory of Umbrella's. But now these places had greatly expanded and became more dangerous.
Main +:
+ old good atmosphere of fear;
+ zombies are more deadly, persistent and unpredictable;
+ mr. X is the second Jack Baker and will chase you anytime and anywhere (you will always hear his loud, heavy steps);
+ new system of damages: every bullet can leave a mark in the flesh of zombies, that looks very great and realistic;
+ moderately recycled familiar locations.
Main -:
- only a few in-game OST (sad but you can buy an original of 98's and that's +200 to atmosphere and nostalgia feelings for sure);
- a bit differences between scenarios and plots mismatches (like in original game).

In general - the game meet all expectations and deserves an 9 / 10.

Now this is how you make a AAA Game! Strange coming from Capcom, the company who microtransactioned street fighter to death. Take Note Activision , Bethesda, Blizzard ! Its called delivering what fans want! Its not a out of season april fools joke , its what happens when you care about the game your making. Whom am I kidding , if you are reading this ; your probably doing it on your phones :0 smh.

Seriously Id like to make it a point to say Thank You Capcom! Thank you for doing this right; I hope every game you make is this good!

1) Jammed with content. Well Worth Price of Admission for Deluxe Edition.
2) Single Player Games Are Still As Kick ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• As Ever When Done Right and With Passion, And Its Done Right Here! Exactly what has been needed and wanted with some surprises!
3) Re-Playability (2 Main Story Mode Takes Of 2 Main Characters )
4) Great Slight Spin on a Classic Story! Nostalgia Bonus Points Here With A Twist That Keeps It Fresh!
5) standard edition and a deluxe edition. No Extra microtransactions trying to milk the gamer. Huge Extra Credit Here!

Classic RE is back and better ! By far the best remake to date. Makes you wish they would remake 0, 1, 3 and Code Veronica X just like this! Resident Evil 2 really takes you back , great tension , classic RE survival horror, live 3rd person camera angle really works great. Was a little worried that it wouldnt but to my surprise, it actually draws you in that much more. So far; very happy with this. If you are a fan of classic RE games, you shouldve bought this already!

RE Engine really comes through here; from the lighting to the gore! its all top notch, blow holes, arms, legs, off of zombies, baracade windows, run like hell when your out of ammo. coupled with a superb soundtrack (even has the classic RE2 sounds and music if you want to swap; deluxe edition) the whole thing is a very cinematic expierence. GTX 980s Users Are Better Served Turning ON DX12 vs DX11. DX12 actually works better in this instance vs DX11. Everything except the image supersampling can be maxed out for 60fps with very few minor hiccups. So just leave it at 100%

RE2 Is a well made AAA game that can stand on Its own. It doesnt need microtransactions nor to solicit the player into season passes or lootbox purchases etc etc.... its done right. It gives the player exactly what the player wants; with loads of content with a great expierence ! it stands on its own 2 feet. This is yet more proof of a dying concept we so desperatley need to get back too as a whole, yes even capcom has been guilty of this in the past, but man o man did they do the right thing here and it works. Good for them and good for the RE Fans! Hopefully Capcom continues this into maybe a RE3 Nemisis Remake? *fingers crossed* as well as their other ips.

Resident Evil 2 is the first horror game i ever purchased after my first playthrough what i can definetly say is: Capcom has remade Resident Evil 2 into something exciting, new, and nostalgic.
It is something that makes me want to know more about the Resident Evil Universe and play more of the games in the Resident Evil Series.

Atmosphere:

Resident Evil 2 takes place at a police station in Raccoon City: A place which should be stockpiled with weapons, ammunation and survival gear
to survive a zombie apocalypse, instead Clarie and Leon both realized that Supplies have been expended, the halls run slick with blood. Corpses: it‚Äôs unclear if they‚Äôre truly dead or reanimated
lay piled around every corner. The walking dead stalk me during my first playthrough as Claire breaking windows, getting back up after shooting them in the face.
Rooms I think are clear of threats are somehow inhabited by new zombies when I return to search for something I missed or a item i need to complete my objective.

The police station is beautifully, gruesomely realized. Some rooms are dark as night, lit only by the blaze of Claire‚Äôs or Leon‚Äôs flashlight. Emergency lighting reflects off the water in flooded
hallways. There is trash and rot in the attics, piled-up office furniture blocking pathways, and it‚Äôs all very realistic-looking

The game is a good teaching point for me who has never played a resident evil game before: Conserve ammo. Run away when I can. conserve healing. And shoot the zombie that is attacking
me in the head till i can confirm that it is truly dead.

Story:

Rookie cop Leon Kennedy and college student Claire Redfield trek to the town of Raccoon City in search of answers. The two are united by a chance encounter but quickly separated by a terrible
accident. What follows is a fight for survival as both Claire and Leon try to escape the city alive, then find themselves caught up in something much bigger.

Gameplay:

The game‚Äôs bizarre puzzles makes me sprint from room to room in search of a diamond-shaped key for a diamond-shaped lock. I develop rolls of film that reveal a single picture of a padlock
combination. A half-eaten police officer dies with a notebook in his hand. The book contains the solution to an elaborate, station-spanning puzzle that requires
three medallions culled from three marble statues ‚Äî and, ludicrously, it‚Äôs my only hope of getting out of this place.

How does Resident Evil 2 justify all this? Raccoon City‚Äôs police department is actually a renovated art museum, a certified genius as devised this series of convoluted puzzles that stand
between me and survival.

The Tyrant who appears at the police station ambushes me when i enter a new room while i am trying to finish my objective, i get a heart attack every time i open a door and he is heading
straight for me, his footsteps can be heard clearly although he is not in the same place as i am lickers ambushes me from the celing while i am trying to shoot them i panicked and miss only to
get hit again, I get shocked when they pop out of nowhere just like some of the other zombies in the game. The creepy and nostalgic sounds at the sewers makes me think twice before
heading further into my objective The Ivy at the lab scares the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of me when i open the door only to see a corpses covered in vines walking towards me.


Pros:
-Graphics are fascinating
-Story is interesting and makes me want to find out more about what happens after the events of Resident Evil 2 and before that
-Atmposphere is nostalgic just like what a actual zombie appocalypse would be like
-Gameplay is simple to understand while being filled with puzzles that can take time to finsh while you are trying to survive from the walking dead

Cons:
-Nothing much to say

Verdict:
Resident Evil 2 is my first horror game and its probably going to be one of the best that i have played. The Atmosphere is facinating and nostalgic just like what a actual zombie appocalypse
would be like, its Story is interesting and makes me want to find out more about what happens after the events of Resident Evil 2 and before that.

This game is so fantastic! There is literally nothing about this game that I don't like. Everything is smooth, the graphics are the future and the game mechanics works very well. Sure you can't dodge but that makes the game even more scary. I have only played RE4, 5 and 6th game (except for revelations) and I got a huge gap in the story. But I don't want to go back to the old graphics and gameplay so this was such a hype for me when it got released and I was NOT disappointed when I played the game. Now I only wish for RE3 and Code Veronica to be re-released.

Oh boy, where to start?
Well, first of all, let me tell you I've been a fan of Resident Evil since the first ever game release. Yup back in 1996!! Although I wasn't born when it came out, I do however remember watching it however long ago that was. I've always loved Resident Evil 1 more than watching and playing 2, but RE2 was also really good. RE3 was good, although I don't remember much. Code Veronica, REALLY good. Resident Evil 4, great, Resident Evil Darkside Chronicles, also surprisingly good. Then Resident Evil 1 Remake, it was everything I loved in a Resident Evil game but with tons of added stuff that made it so much more enjoyable. RE5, & RE6 was different but also good. It made me scared of upcoming games as they did become progressively worse after 4.

But with all the being said, what about Resident Evil 2 remake? Well, let me say that it's what I hoped for a long time. Gorgeous and atmospheric graphics, optimization that I'd never believe a game like this could have, especially considering Capcom is known for their bad ports, but for RE2, I am not sure if it's a port or not, if it is, it's a darn good one.
Now, playing the original games how did they capture the characters? Really well. The voice actors and animations brought these characters to their original roots.

Onto the actual gameplay, what's it like?

Great, it's very friendly to new players, with aim assist with or without a controller, which you may disable and enable at any time. The action isn't too different from RE4 5 and 6, except this is far less arcade-y. Which is good in my opinion. What about the horror? Well, it's a horror game done right, not flooded or filled with jump scares and loud noises. RE2 allows the atmosphere and the monsters like the ""Iron Man"" take control of the horror.

Now the run down, what do I think of it as a whole?

Extremely satisfied with my purchase, not the type of person to throw $50-$60 at a game, but this is an exception, it's just a fantastic game. It blends so well and Capcom has really made a masterpiece, it's a horror game done right, a remake done right, and I say this with confidence that this is the game of the year, 2019's best right here, Resident Evil 2 Remake.",Recommended," February 1, 2019"

Resident Evil 2 Remake is the reimagination of the 1998 Resident Evil 2. You play as either Leon Scott Kennedy, or Claire Redfield, as they try to survive and escape from the zombie infested Raccoon City. Returning back to its survival horror roots, resources are scarce, and flight is most of the time preferred than fight, with various puzzles that required to be solved in order to progress. Unlike in the original game, this game will not have a tank like control, instead its more of the over the shoulder third person style of control, similar to RE 4, 5 and 6.

In game, not only zombies will be getting in your way, but along with zombified beasts, mutated experimented creatures, or worse, a bioengineered creature hellbent on just killing you. It's up to you to decide how to bypass these obstacles safely in order to progress. Similar to the original, there are two routes for each character, thought they just relabelled it as 1st run and 2nd run, unlike the scenario A and B labels given in the original game. By playing through both scenarios for both Leon and Claire, you will get to see the entire story, since some events in the 2nd run are not covered in the 1st run, along with how each of them survive Raccoon City.

This game does have some value in replayability, since it has two routes for each characters. Furthermore, this is cemented by unlockable weapons when completing any of the route under certain circumstances, in addition to the free DLC for Ghost Survivors, and the return of the classic side modes, Tofu and Hunk mini games. It also manages to recapture the old survival horror feeling instead of being gung ho like in RE 5 and 6. Shout out to a particular obstacle who keeps getting in the way, and constantly threaten Leon and Claire by just simply being nearby them with his thunderous footsteps and menacing figure.

Unfortunately, the two routes mentioned earlier, while having some minor differences in events, is practically identical to each other. It even breaks the story plot, since the puzzles done by both character are the same, which doesn't make sense if it was solved already by either of them. Same goes for the events that transpires in both routes, it doesn't make sense for something to happen twice. The DLC game modes, while being challenging, are pretty short in length, since they are mainly as a speedrun challenge.

Despite that, I would still heavily recommend this game. Sure it has some flaws, some stuffs from the original are missing here and the routes doesn't make sense, but it's still a great game. Get it if you can, you won't regret it.

This game is really challenging (I played on ""Hardcore"", though) and creepy as hell.
If a game deserves the definiton ""Survival Horror"" then it's definitely this game.

I haven't had any technical issues, everything ran fine, also I haven't encountered any bugs (having completed only Scenario A, so far), therefore I'll talk only about the difficulty a bit (Hardcore):
Since this game is quite challenging I would strongly advise against playing on ""hardcore"" unless you're mentally prepared for the challenge or you've gotten some experience with this game, already. I was constantly struggling to stay alive and most of the time I had to use all healing items as soon I found them...only to get hit a few minutes later. Also worth mentioning is that on ""hardcore"" the enemies hit really hard. Even an average zombie will hurt you to the point where you're almost dead.. Usually you won't survive 2 hits without healing yourself after the first hit OR ""buffing"" yourself with the right herb-combination. If your constitution is temporarily buffed, you'll survive 3-4 blows before dying.
Also the ammo is really sparse, too and since the enemies take more hits on ""hardcore"", the ammo-problem amplifies greatly.
On my first run, though I managed to have at least a few shots left on reserve (except for one time, when I had NOTHING left but I managed to survive). If you play smart and carefully pick the encounters, you should get through this game with always a few shots left. On the other hand, the boss encounters will drain your ammo really fast ;)

I haven't played the game on ""normal"" but I know ppl who did and based on their experiences I can safely say, that normal is way easier than hardcore (zombies will need to hit you like 3-4 times, before you drop dead) and the enemies take less rounds before they die.
Therefore I suggest:
-if you're a masochist or a Pro -> Go for ""Hardcore""
-if you're an average gamer who wants a forgiving experience -> go for ""Normal""
-ppl who want to finish the story without having too much problems probably should go for ""assisted/easy""

About Mr.X:
in the forums you find lots of threads from people complaining how unfair Mr. X is and that he destroys the whole experience and such stuff. In my opinion THAT'S NOT NOT THE CASE!
Mr. X was a pleasant surprise for me and I was thrilled by the challenge he imposed on me. If you know the surroundings (which you really should ASAP) you can easily outrun Mr. X up to the point where he stops chasing you and starts roaming around, looking for you. There are also certain rooms which he won't enter, therefore you should be able to catch your breath, now and then.
My opinion about Mr. X: love him!

Up until 12.01.2019 the best horror game was ""Alien: Isolation"", now it's ""Resident Evil 2: Remake"".

""RESIDUNT EVEEEYL TOOOOOOOOOOO ! !""

I really missed this at the start of Capcoms wonderful remake. Though I do hear that there's an original OST DLC available, so maybe it comes with that. Same with the bingy bongy bell music that you got upon first entering the Police Station in the original. Which isn't there in the OST of this new vision of a 90's classic.

Released at a time when the zombie genre was fresh and new, Resident Evil 2 broke more ground and blasted the first game of the series out of the water in every way possible. Now we come to this generation and tbh I do find it quite hard to be motivated to play a zombie genre game these days. I drew the line at Rebellion's Zombie Army Trilogy, figuring it couldn't get any better than this. And so far haven't endeavoured to play a zombie game since. Not even THAT one from Techland, the one every bugger and their dog keeps hassling me to get into. And all I keep thinking is, ""not another bloody zombie game"". Which is ironic considering that I've never battered so much as an eyelid blasting one form of alien life or another, in all the various shooters and wotnot that I've played over the years.

But with that said, no way was I going to pass on playing an update of one of Capcoms most legendary titles. But is it better than the original ? Well if I keep the rose tinted glasses of the past on, I'd most certainly say, NO! Though once they are off and by todays standards, RE2 hasn't aged well at all. What with it's terrible voice acting, dodgy CGI and awful tank controls (How did we ever manage eh ? lol). There's a lot in the original that now leaves a lot to be desired. And to be fair you could say the same for RE2R.

Even for the modern third person experience that it is. It still feels comfortably retro in the way it plays. Especially after all the little additions that have been in play since RE4. Most of which have been done away with. Though at least you can walk while aiming, so there's that at least. But the act of trying to avoiding the dead does seem a tad unmeasured and haphazard, in ways that didn't plague the original. Even worse when you've got your back to them. Zombies that you could easily avoid in the original, now seem to be more than a little nuisance. As they reach for you from behind, in way that would make Plastic Man & Mr. Tickle flush with admiration. One second they are at a comfortable distance, and the next (as soon as your back is turned), they are on top of you chewing at the back of your head. Which has certainly had me scratching at mine once or twice. All the funky little QTEs of previous Evils aren't here. Although not a bad thing, I do miss being able to get away from stuff with the use of some quick reactions and all that. Instead your only way of avoiding damage is to have a secondary weapon equipped. Either a knife or a grenade which you can stuff into a zombies mouth, in order to get away from their grasp. If you have nothing to hand, you take damage and that is that.

And if there is one annoying habit RE2R has, is that it loves to break it's own rules every now and again. I didn't like the Lickers in this. Far too bullet spongey and the fact that at the start the game tells you that they are blind and react to sound. So I figured, great, Perhaps there's a chance for some clever stealth here. But No ! You can stand still and not move a muscle. And they still just waltz right up to you and eat your face. So was marginally disappointed about that.

Also wasn't all that enamoured with the shooting itself. Guns seem very ""wispy"", weak and quite useless at times.

Then the map, which gives you excellent feedback, except when it doesn't (looking at you underground carpark !!!)... Which tells you what you have searched and what there is still to look at with a simple colour coding. Again, except when it doesn't. Then you're left wandering around, wondering HTF you're going to progress. So perhaps it's probably not the best thing to place too much faith in the map system, and make sure you search everywhere thoroughly. Which unfortunately means going through the traditional survival horror tedium of walking round the edge of every possible surface, spamming the action button.

My biggest bone of contention however, would be . Originally in Clair Redfields half of RE2. Now Leon too gets to experience the terror of what I can only refer to as a f***ing nuisance. Some players love this guy. Some players are hating on him with a vengeance... And I can see why. The sod will follow you around everywhere if he gets wind of you. And losing him is nowhere near as easy as it was in the original. Although seemingly barred from entering most save areas. This guy is one giant hungry bloodhound that will pursue you relentlessly during various stages of the game. Not sure if it's a little too much for my tastes. And will certainly go a long way toward stealing any thunder away from , when the inevitable RE3 remake hits. Seems a given that we're now just going to be in for more of the same. Only with a reskinned Mr.X, armed with a rocket launcher and gatling gun. But we'll see I suppose.

Haven't been too keen on how long you spend in the Police Station either, really. It seemed to go on forever, going round and round in endless circles. Which after a while just felt like complete tedium. And even after you get out of RCPD HQ. You still end up circling back from time to time. Which just sort of feels cheap in a way.

Under the hood, RE2R is mechanically and technically sound. Very easy to pick up and just play and is as challenging as you want it to be. With a Normal and Hard mode. And even comes with a super easy mode for casuals and ""professional"" game reviewers (:P). I started this on Normal and found it very easy to get into. Though by half time, it does toughen up considerably. But eases off as you continue to gain more weapons and conserve ammo. With the major difficulty spikes coming slow and steady, with the introduction of new enemies and boss battles. Which are both as cleverly inventive as they are excellently designed. And in this, really is what makes it a very traditional, old school Resident Evil experience. Flowing with pretty much the exact same panache as the original trilogy did. Making RE2R (despite whatever flaws it holds), .

It does seem to have suffered the same audio malady as Capcoms re-release of Killer 7. The mixing is awfully quiet again. Not sure what's going off in the Capcom sound department. But I reckon someone over there, either needs replacing or an ear trumpet.

If I am being blunt, RE2R is far from the 10/10 superduper experience that is currently being touted. But it's still a decent enough survival horror to get your teeth into. Not at all sure if it surpasses the original, hard to really gauge what with all the mixing up of the events and set pieces that's involved. Which isn't a bad thing, who'd want to play the exact same game as 20 years ago? It sticks quite faithfully in some ways to it's original counterpart, then in other ways doesn't really seem to go far enough to feel modern. But if this is your bag and you're not sick to death of the zombie scene just yet. You're more than likely buying into one solid gem of a third person experience.

So yeah, etc.

Introduction:
Resident Evil 2 ‚Äì Remake is, as you can judge by its name, a remake of one of the most iconic horror games, originally released in 1998. Game manages to combine quest and survival horror parts & keeps them very well-balanced. This time Capcom decided to introduce original universe to those people who are still unfamiliar with it, by recreating whole game from scratch and moving it to a decent 3D engine. And so far it seems they made the right choice!

Storyline:
The story takes place in 1998, when unknown virus outbreak hits Raccoon city. Virus itself has 100% death rate for every infected person. People affected by the virus turn mad and try to bite everybody, or even eat them alive. Local police force offers a shelter inside the police station but such decision creates a trap, resulting whole police station building to be besieged by the hordes of the infected. As if not enough, wounded people who found safe haven inside the building also turn zombies and start attacking everyone.

Players‚Äôll take a look on this whole situation from the view of two common people ‚Äì Leon Kennedy, an outsider police rookie, and Claire Redfield, usual girl, searching for her brother. Both campaigns are interconnected and both characters visit same places every now and then. Game also offers second runs, where some of the events, including the endings, may alternate, depending on which hero reached key places first.

Last but not least, there are 2 additional scenarios, where 2 secondary characters, USS member named Hunk and local meme, TOFU (yes, huge walking human-size piece of cheese) have to reach the extraction point. Each campaign playthrough grants players with various bonuses, such as costumes for characters, or weapon skins. Capcom also promised bringing additional low-poly models straight from original RE2 and yet another additional gamemode, called ‚ÄòThe Ghost Survivors‚Äô, which would tell us what could‚Äôve happened if some secondary characters didn‚Äôt die.

Gameplay itself presents us a challenging 3rd person old school survival horror, which encourages long, slow and thoughtful area exploration with careful inventory item management. There aren‚Äôt many enemies present on the map, but the ones you meet may provide you with quite some challenge. Zombies alone, while being slow and stupid, can crawl over the tables, break doors and windows, for example. Combine that with low amount of ammo and literally tons of health for each monster, and you‚Äôll get a challenge even with such a simple enemy type. So, to put it the right way ‚Äì sometimes it‚Äôs better to avoid the fight, or at least incapacite your enemy by shooting out their limbs, or else you are risking to be left armless while facing yet another pack of enemies.

Game also possesses a lot of riddles. Some of them may confuse a new player at start, but in fact they‚Äôre not too hard and usually become rather easy, once you find all the necessary items. Speaking of items ‚Äì overall you can divide them on 3 main categories:



Sometimes, in order to solve a riddle, or craft useful stuff, you‚Äôll have to combine multiple things in one piece, or gather necessary information, by examining an item closely through the inventory. The last thing worth mentioning here is inventory upgrade. It happens when your character finds empty combat pouches and picks them up.

So, overall gameplay looks like this: you explore the area, while fighting, or avoiding different creatures, find out what blocks your path and solve this riddle. Then you unlock multiple doors, which connect multiple old rooms and open new pass forward. Gameplay slightly changes once (spoiler alert!) a huge immortal boss arrives. He starts hunting for your character, so you‚Äôll have to watch your step carefully and escape as soon as he finds you. This idea, however, falls short on practice, as even though it sounds cool on paper, on practice this boss mostly annoys you. Luckily, you won‚Äôt meet him too often.

To put it real simple ‚Äì the graphics looks amazing. You can see that by screenshots, but apart from top notch model quality, Capcom also brought high quality animations, advanced limb system, where you can shoot off various body parts of your enemies, and, of course, advanced gore system. You‚Äôll see a lot of blood and torn off bodies and limbs, so consider that not only as appreciation, but also as a warning, in case you‚Äôre a sensitive person.

Overall, game atmosphere feels really apocalyptic, and graphics plays vital role in it ‚Äì all those rotten bodies, burnt cars and broken lighting inside the building, all of it immerses the player into a cruel unforgiving world, filled with evil and despair.

Just the same as with graphics, the sound feels really amazing, be it calm ambient, or some distant roar of yet another zombie woken up. Perhaps, we can say that the graphics in RE2 ‚Äì Remake serves as driving force of the atmosphere, but it wouldn‚Äôt have about half of that atmosphere without the sound of such quality.

















Overall, it‚Äôs rather clear that RE2 ‚Äì Remake is a really successful remake of an infamous cult classic horror game. All of the key elements and characters are present. Atmosphere feels so old yet so‚Ä¶ qualitative. It‚Äôs one of those few AAA titles nowadays that fully deserves the money asked.",Recommended," January 27, 2019"

I am a stubborn fan of tank controls and fixed camera angles, and have argued (and will continue to argue) for their merits in traditional survival horror. I'm also a devoted fan of the Resident Evil 1 remaster, and consider it not only the best RE game but one of the most perfect games ever made, period. So I had, let's say, particular standards going into Resident Evil 2. I expected I'd probably dislike it, and even if I DID enjoy what i assumed would be RE2 through the lens of RE4, there was no possible way it would be half as good as REmake.

I was wrong.

RE2make is the best RE game in at least a decade. It doesn't quite surpass the original remaster but it's comfortably within spitting distance. Almost everything that makes a good survival horror game is here. You have to be conscious of your resources. You have to be conscious of your movement. You have to be conscious of your environment and the routes and shortcuts that snake through it. It modernizes things that might put new players off, but does so in ways that preserves almost all of the original design. And not only that, it sprinkles in modern innovations to enhance that design, with Mr. X now serving as a dynamic navigational concern as well as a jumpscare machine, and zombies more free to wander around areas and even follow the player through doors.

It's not quite perfect (the visuals are fairly bland and some effects like screen space reflections are incredibly ugly, and most of the boss battles end up being exercises in frustration, and for some reason zombies remain completely unaffected by being hit in the fact with doors leading to a few cheap grabs). But it's very very very good. VERY very very good. And should be considered required purchasing for anyone who likes the pre-RE4 brand of survival horror, or anyone who wants to get that experience without any tank-control-scented barriers to entry.",Recommended," February 10, 2019"

HECK YES! This is how a remake is done!
I pre-purchased the deluxe version for the extra stuff but also I really wanted the swapable, original RE2 BGM. Since I started playing it, I haven't even bothered with the default new music. ^^
As fan of the original RE2 in the late 90's, this game just blew me away. The detail is amazing!
I'm really enjoying this game and I'm not gonna bother speed running through it like an idiot. ""Look at me I beat the game in under 2 hours!!! OMG!"" (>_> Golf Clap). How do you even enjoy a game like that? Just to brag about something chances are many other Speed Runners beat you to? SMH... Oh, I am going to fully enjoy this game taking my time and looking and exploring everything. So if you see my gameplay time over 20 hours, you know why. ^^

So aside from the obvious pros, what about the cons?
I only have one really. Depending on your rig this game can work like a charm, can be buggy or not work at all. I have seen quite a lot of people that have been having problem getting this game running and the game would crash with a notice ""Fatal Error Exit"". Others having problems with graphical bugs and random screen darkening and I even noticed it myself in some cutscenes. Hopefully Capcom will patch those out soon.

Other than that, the game is awesome. I really can't complain. Definitely a thumbs up! :D",Recommended," January 27, 2019"

Resident Evil 2 is a game that truly needs no introduction. It's a from-the-ground-up remake of the classic 1998 survival horror game of the same name, and one that has been highly anticipated ever since it was first speculated that Capcom was working on such a release. The inspiration to the famed developer/publisher came from a fan project that was aiming to recreate Resident Evil 2 in first-person mode, using a modern day game engine. How well does this release hold up to the hype, and is it one of the best releases in the Resident Evil franchise thus far?

To say that Resident Evil 2 is merely a remake would be a catastrophic misclassification; more-so it is a reimagining of the events that transpired in Raccoon City on September 28, 1998. While much of the core of the original release has stayed intact, just as much has been left out, moved around, or further fleshed out. Players take on the role of either Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie cop who just showed up for his first day on the job, or Claire Redfield; college student and sister of original Resident Evil character Chris Redfield, who is searching for her brother. Leon and Claire meet up in the beginning and proceed to have overlapping story arcs throughout the game, but they both find out that their ultimate goal is to stop the spread of the G-Virus; a creation of the evil pharmaceutical company Umbrella, and the cause of the zombie outbreak.

Although one should never play or avoid a game based merely on its graphics, we should all take a moment to appreciate just how jaw-droppingly gorgeous Resident Evil 2 looks. Leon, Claire, and the rest of the cast look life-like and are visibly younger in appearance; which gives a great additional layer of depth to the franchise. The original release had little to no atmosphere, and was relatively bright; especially in comparison to this gritty and visually dark recreation. Very few areas are not slathered with blood and gore, and many windows burst which causes the flood of rain outside to make its way in. The lighting is just absolutely phenomenal, and players will never be able to guess what's around the next tight, darkened corridor. All of this graphical prowess and the game runs at a smooth-as-butter 60+ FPS with no crashing and no bugs; a much appreciated and highly applauded feat.

Truly Capcom has managed to put the ""survival"" back in survival horror; a genre that has long since neglected its difficult roots in lieu of the more conventional ""fun-for-all"" modern day appeal. Though the atmospheric effects and environments in Resident Evil 2 are downright frightening in every aspect, the real scares happen any time an enemy shows up. Mere zombies can take anywhere from 6-8 headshots before they finally go down, and many times they stand back up an additional time or two. With such limited resources, this overwhelming, bullet sponge mechanic forces players to make executive decisions on which foes are worth taking down, and which ones can otherwise be skirted around time and time again through the many back-and-forth treks that will be made within the tight corridors of the Raccoon City Police Department (RPD).

The aforementioned is also one of the downsides to Resident Evil 2. There are just so many zombies at any given time that it makes getting around the RPD a tiring chore. This goes even more for the Second Runs, which are arguably more difficult B-Side scenarios for both Leon and Claire. Capcom has introduced a new feature in this reimagining, and that is the use of wooden planks to board up windows. Of course, the supply of these boards is limited and not every window can be taken care of. Windows left unattended will keep letting floods of zombies in, and in some cases will cause areas of the game to become nearly impassable over time. It also doesn't help that all of the high-octane weapons are kept hidden away until the last hour or two of gameplay, with no means to unlock them as beginning weapons via subsequent playthroughs.

This brings us to another point; the lack of unlockables, which is a staple in the Resident Evil series. Sure, there are tons of character models, concept art, and challenges to unlock. However, Resident Evil 2 is stingy when it comes to anything else. Without providing any spoilers, players will be disappointed in the lack of weapons that the game houses overall, and even more let down with the absence of available unlocks for those that are present. There are two scenarios each for both Leon and Claire, plus an additional game mode that will become unlocked once players finish at least one of the Second Runs. Each of these runs takes 5-8 hours upon their first playthrough, meaning that players will get a maximum of 35-ish hours out of the game with the other unlockable mode. This is of course not counting the die-hard fans who will go back to achievement hunt such difficult gems as getting an S-Rank with both characters and beating the game in under 14,000 steps.

When it comes down to it, the Resident Evil 2 remake is everything that fans dreamed of when it comes down to its campaign. The true ending isn't even unveiled until players make the dedicated leap to finish the game for the third time via a Second Run; a necessity to obtaining some form of closure, as the main ending is underwhelming and jarringly abrupt. However, Capcom has seemed to forget a major component to what makes a Resident Evil game part of their franchise; unlockables. It's what keeps players interested in countless runs through the same slog that can be easily reduced to a mere couple of hours with optimal routes. As far as replayability goes, it's not here, but the game is worth playing a few times over... just don't expect more than 20 hours out of the most casual player.

The only way AMAZING games like this will continue to be made is if we show publishers that true survival horror games are still in demand and profitable. Every time you buy a gem like this on sale instead of full price, you're showing talented game developers that their art has less worth than games like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing Fortnite or Call of Duty.

While I have played the more modern style of resident evil games that exists in resident evil 4 and resident evil 5, I have not played the original resident evil or the original resident evil 2. This review is about how I, a casual fan of the series, experienced the remake. This remake is incredibly well done.

The environment and ambience in all stages of the game is amazing. The only thing that is somewhat of a blemish in this area is the cheesy voice lines from Leon and Claire. However, other moments, such as the first time you walk down the watery hallway and the first time you see a Licker, are intense and terrifying. These moments create a very powerful fear of what's around the corner, which is much easier said than done. I think all horror games should strive to create this emotion in the player, and very few are successful at this. Amnesia: the Dark Descent is the best example of a game that makes you afraid, and while the Remake does not go to Amnesia levels, it played its cards as a zombie game very well.

Puzzles are not difficult and the process of running through the map and gathering puzzle pieces to put together to make progress is a time-tested way to keep the player entertained and having fun. Old school resident evil games operate with this method at their core, and it works out very well. Bonus puzzles that are not necessary to continue the game but offer very helpful resources also entice the player to keep looking in every nook and cranny and experience all that the game has to offer.

The first resident evil that I played was resident evil 4, which is much more arcade combat than the survivalist take employed by resident evils 1-3 and the remakes. You are not a god, in fact you are a bytch, and I think it works well. Adjusting to the idea that I should avoid or impede zombies rather than exploding their heads with a suplex did take some time. There are times when for some reason, certain zombies just won't get stunned or blowing their legs off takes more bullets than expected. These times can be frustrating and it can make the player feel as though the game is cheating. I do think that this survivalist approach which forces the player to conserve ammo and to choose when and where to engage is entertaining and enjoyable to play. It is a different take on video games when most other games out there are force feeding ammunition down players' throats, holding the players' hand, and all people care about is how to kill enemies in an even more spectacular fashion than other games. It forces the player to be resourceful, which makes the player feel good after achieving this resourcefulness. Lastly, not pushing the player into combat at every turn lets some of the pressure off of the game for not having the best combat. Killing zombies isn't actually all that fun, and so encouraging the player not to do it all the time lets pressure off of the game for having not so entertaining combat. It is, after all, a horror game, and you should be afraid of the enemies. This remake achieves a good balance of the player's power in that you can obliterate zombies with a shotgun, but you can't kill them all, so you have to respect and fear them.

Enemy diversity is maintained well at a steady pace throughout the game. The player first learns how to deal with regular zombies, then lickers, then Mr. X, and then all of them at the same time, and then the plant enemies are introduced. Each enemy is a different puzzle in itself. The player has tools to deal with each enemy type effectively but must do so with guile and resourcefulness rather than shoot everything on the screen. The diversity in enemies keeps the game fresh and prevents the player from getting bored. Mr. X can be somewhat annoying when there is no time to solve the puzzle that is blocking progress because he keeps following the player around. Other than that, the enemies in the game look good, they are dangerous, and outplaying them is fun.

The story I don't have much comment on, as I am sure that the creators of the game would rather not have had the exact same story that was thought up over a couple decades ago. It is a little lacking, but back in the day they did not have gigabytes of space to work with. It gets the job done.

The graphics and visuals are outstanding. Sometimes Leon and Claire's faces look weird, but you aren't really looking at them all the time.

Weapon variety is enough to make the player feel like a badass. Upgrading the hip pouch makes the player feel good, for who doesn't like leveling up.

Having two scenarios gives the game some replay value, although having to play the game twice to get the full story is a little annoying. This problem is mostly a non-factor since the arsenal available to each character differs enough to keep the game fresh.

Overall, I really enjoyed this game and didn't find too many flaws. It's a great way to spend 20 or so hours, especially if you get the DLC. While I haven't played the DLC, I have heard that it is good.",Recommended, May 14

Resident Evil 2 is a remake of the game which was released in 1998. I never played the original version so this was a completely new experience for me.

The good

‚Ä¢ Play as either Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy. After you complete the game with one character, you can play a new game plus mode with the other character where the story will be slightly different, you‚Äôll meet different NPCs and find different weapons.
‚Ä¢ Excellent survival horror gameplay. Every enemy is legitimately dangerous if you don‚Äôt respect them, even the basic zombies. Ammo and health pickups are limited, so you have to be careful not to waste anything. Sometimes its best to avoid enemies and conserve ammo.
‚Ä¢ Enemies include zombies, lickers, dogs, a couple of strange mutants, and multiple bosses (who, in true Resident Evil style, just won‚Äôt stay dead).
‚Ä¢ Good weapon variety including handgun, magnum, SMG, shotgun, grenade launcher, shock rifle, flamethrower and minigun. Plus secondary weapons such as knife, flashbang and frag grenade that can be used to escape from enemies who grab you.
‚Ä¢ Some weapons and upgrades, like weapon mods and pouches to increase inventory size, are earned by solving puzzles, which rewards you for exploring.
‚Ä¢ Interesting locations including the Raccoon City police station, a nearby orphanage and an underground laboratory. The graphics look amazing, and the areas where the lights are out and you‚Äôre exploring with a flashlight helps to create a horror atmosphere.
‚Ä¢ Good story and great voice acting.
‚Ä¢ Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.
‚Ä¢ I didn‚Äôt suffer any bugs, crashes or framerate issues.

The bad

‚Ä¢ Inventory system is occasionally annoying because you‚Äôre not allowed to simply put an item on the floor and pick it up again later. Any item you drop is discarded forever, which means you sometimes have to go back to a storage box to free up space to pick up a quest item that needs to be used on an object 10 feet away.

An excellent remake from the original Resident Evil 2. Capcom has gone back to their roots of what makes Resident Evil a survival horror game.

The graphics are superb, the story and lore are interesting but can be confusing at times and the gameplay is super enjoyable and can be summarised as an updated & less clunky version of gameplay that Resident Evil 4 and 5 has to offer, however it can still be quite scary at times.

I enjoyed every second of this game and can easily say that this has to be my favourite game that I bought in 2019.

Possibly the new bar in making an excellent remake. With RE2 and the RE1 Remake under their belts, no one does complete remakes better than Capcom.

Shows what you can do when you take a classic and add modern polish and design to it. The old elements that supposedly didn't have a place in modern games like the light puzzling & backtracking elements mix perfectly with the top-class level design and excellent pacing.

I really can't compliment the level design and pacing enough, I've played this game like 7 times from start to finish since it came out and I can't remember the last time I did something like that. I'm not even into speedrunning but the game is set up in such a way that's it's super fun to blast through it in like 2-3 hours, start to finish.

The only complaints I have are minor, and those being the 2nd routes being mostly an afterthought outside of the very beginning of the segment. I don't give a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about the story, but a little more item and enemy remixing would've help a bit. Also Leon's a boring dweeb in this game and his story elements are pretty lame compared to Claire, who at least has some personality.

In short, a must have for anyone with a passing interest in the nearly dead survival-horror genre or for people that just want to play a great game with outstanding level design and pacing.",Recommended," February 11, 2019"

Long story short: It's like sending a kid to kindergarten one day, then 20 years later, watching the same kid walk back home with a college degree. As a parent, you couldn't feel more proud.

Resident Evil 2 is a 3rd person survival horror remake of the 1998 release. Set in a seemingly cliche zombie apocalypse after the disaster at the Arklay Mountain mansion (RE1), you delve deeper into a conspiracy involving a popular pharmaceutical company and city officials of Raccoon City. You can choose to play as Leon, a rookie cop on his first day or Claire, a college student looking for her brother. Along the way, you'll come across a few survivors which will drive the story forward...

On the art/graphic side, this game is oozing with professionalism. I thought RE7 was excellent on the facial animations and level design, but RE2 goes even further and drives it home big-time. Instead of going for a 1:1 replica of the old map, Capcom took some artistic liberties and remodeled the layout in a newer, fresher way. Each rooms are cluttered with details that makes exploring even more fun. I spent a lot of time just walking around slowly, stuffing my nose in every possible corners.

In the sound department, it's as good as previous RE's. The long years working on the RE franchise as allowed Capcom to master their craft and it's on full display here, same goes with graphics. Great voice actors that complement well their digital counter-part, providing believable emotions. Great ambient soundtrack that helps build atmosphere. Each rooms and corridor have unique audio range and echo, so each sound coming from your character resonates well with the type of room you're in. It's not mandatory, but I'd strongly suggest you play through this game at least once with good headphones.

Some of the gameplay feature from the old RE2 makes a come-back, including Scenario B, The 4th Survivor, a ranking system and unlockables. Scenario B allows you to experience the event of the opposing character you chose at the start, providing a different view on the story and extending your playtime. It might seem mundane to newer player, but it used to be a neat feature in the original due to how you had to switch CDs and use your cleared save file to access said Scenario B.

In the PC technical side, this game has every possible options to please. Lots of graphic options, sounds configurations, customizable keyboard and multiple controller setup which, thank god, allows me to move Sprint away from the Left Joystick Click, something I hate with a passion in ANY video games ever. I tried both KB/M and controller. KB/M feels tight and as snappy as RE7 (looking at UI navigation). However, it can't be denied that this game is best played with a controller. Controlling your character and camera feels more smooth and natural than KB/M's edgy mouse-look and square-rery WASD movement.

The only negative aspect of the game, for me, is simply the fact that this game isn't 100% original. It's a remake, so, Capcom already had a mental blueprint of it all to begin with. This game reeks of fan service and maybe a little despair from Capcom trying to reconnect with a wider RE fanbase, which was arguably divided since RE4's shift to 3rd person action and its sequels... However, I think this remake is doing it right by uniting all the good things that made each Resident Evil good and fun to play. Perhaps it was a good thing they waited this long. An RE2 remake 10 years ago probably wouldn't have been as impressive as what we have now...

Congratulations Capcom. You did it. I wish you the best in the years to come, either with RE8 or the next R3make, if there's any plans for it.

I strongly recommend this game to any fans of the survival horror genre and zombie movies. Fueled by fan tears and developper blood, this is the stuff of dreams.

More than I hoped for
When capcom made the announcement video some 3 years ago that they are working on an RE2 remake I didn't think much of it, the series have been on a steady decline in the eyes of the fans... Even tho the games sold quite well, but that's besides the point. And as many I have forgotten all about it untill all the E3 demo footage, it looked quite good and it's even better than it looked like.

The return to survival horror
Many would have said that the ""Survival Horror"" genre Capcom popularized some two decades ago is dead, that it just doesn't fit the modern era. This game is a proof that actually no, the genre can still stand on its own feet in the modern days. The limited resources make you question which enemy to kill and which to leave alive. Searching all over the place for some healing items and other spare consumables while having zombies behind your back. It's quite a unique experience. If you're sick of being ""defensless"" in modern horror games aka. the style Amnesia is most known for and can't quite find an enjoyement in ""horror games"" that are really more action oriented where weapons are plentiful like Dying Light or Dead Rising this strikes the perfect middle ground where you may have a lot of guns at your disposal but you never seem to have enough ammo to deal with what the game is throwing at you, it's quite beautiful and terrifying. And one can't forget the other essentials of survival horror games. Backtracking and puzzles, it's all here, you'll be walking through the police station back and forth trying to find your way to the next objective with puzzles blocking your way. Tho I have to say the puzzles were not exactly challanging, you will not get stuck on them and you can even solve some by brute force. The combination locks might take you 5 minutes with brute force to get through but that may be faster than finding a film and making the photo with the combination on it in the dark room in the first place, it's not a big deal and maybe it's for the best that people will not get stuck on puzzles but maybe a bit more challange would be nice.

Man does this game look ugly, in the best possible way. The RE Engine keeps on giving, this is the best looking zombie game, period. Zombies may have stopped scaring you 10 years ago, they are kind of overused by now, it feels like every other game uses zombies but this game somehow managed to make them scary again. The detail of the walking corpses is amazing, not to mention the very detailed body damage you can cause with weapons. It's quite ""nice"" seeing the whole face peeled off with a shotgun headshot. If you remember being amazed by the car destructions in Burnout 3, prepare to be just as amazed by the ""body destruction"" in RE2. It may be smarter to preserve ammo and just... shoot a leg of the zombies in some room, much easier to dodge them when you'll be making your way through it again later down the line. Everything is quite detailed in the game, never did I think that I would like a sewer area. There was not a single texture that felt low-res and the lighting is really breathtaking in some areas. The game really is a... weird joy to look at.

Music is very important for me in a game, I can really appreciate a good soundtrack, it sometimes makes or breaks the game. The music in this game kind of falls flat, I much prefer the original OST with much more memorable tracks. I can only recall one track from the new soundtrack, the mr. X one, it makes him that much more terryfing in my opinion. Now there is an option to switch to the original OST, but you're going to have to buy the Deluxe Edition for it which sucks, I really believe this should have been a free option from the get go or maybe an unlockable but what are you going to do. Overall the music is not going to be something you think back on after playing this game, it's really not that great, it's by no means bad just eh...
On the other hand the sound quallity is amazing, Capcom really put their new studio to good use and everything in the game sounds great, from the zombies growling to the ominous mr. X footsteps through the halls, it's an experience and I highly recommend you play with headphones to get the full enjoyement out of this.

Already slighly touched on this. The gameplay is pure survival horror at its best, you will be thinking about each shot you make, each healing item you will have to use will hurt, the game will keep you on your toes at all times. You will confidently learn the layout of the RPD station in no time, no need for a map anymore, thst's great! You will start feeling less tense about traversing the location and then the game throws the most hated enemy in this game in your face. Mr. X, he will not stop going after you, unlike the original PS game where he appeared only in scripted situations, the Mr. X in this game is very unpredictable. Some find him to be an annoyance at best but I think he's the best addition to the game by far. Lickers are a type of enemy you have to slowly walk by, since they are blind they only go after you if they hear you, easy. But with Mr. X behind you, it's not quite possible to slow down and walk, this makes for some of the most tense moments you have experienced in quite a while. The game is different in all aspects from the original counterpart, if you've been speedrunning the original RE2, it doesn't mean you will not get surprised in this game anymore, everything is familiar but also mixed. Layouts of each maps are different, enemies appear elsewhere from where you remember them and items are not in the locations you remember them being at. Everything is new but stays true to its original counterpart. This is not a lazy remake, it's a true remake and I wish more games did this.
Bosses are kind of on the easy side, I never felt too challanged by any of them and they sure as hell don't match the horrors you will experience with Mr. X chasing you down a hallway full of lickers. They are not bad but definitely not the highlight of the game by any means.

Any RE vetaran knows that RE canon is a joke and quite frankly, who's here for the story anyway, the game will not blow you away by the plot, that never was the focus of RE games. You can play as Either Leon or Clair, Leon being the rookie cop on his first day in the force and Clair being the girl just trying to find his brother, both arriving into Racoon City at the worst possible time. Right from the begining you may start questioning the logic in the game, the city is in a pretty bad zombie outbreak yet they don't seem to have any trouble getting in suggesting the city is not quarantined and blocked off from the outside world. You already encounter zombies outside the city in the opening scene for crying out loud. The few interactions Clair and Leon have between eachother after the intro scene are not very good either. Second run games where you play as the other one do not really match up either, not as good as in the original. The original had a mechanic in place where if you took some gun in the first run and then played the second run, the gun would not be there for the other character for example, that's not present here making the two playthroughs feel kinda disconnected when they shoud, in theory, be happening simultaneously. Not that it takes away from the overall enjoyement but it's just something the remake could have done much better. But again, this is not very important to the game in general so it's easy to just look past these missteps and move on.

If you're wondering if this is worth the full pricetag, it very much is. The game is phenomenal and I did not expect it to be this good by any means. I never hoped for an RE game this good, I was expecting a mediocore experience. I don't regred my purchase at all.",Recommended," March 2, 2019"

FREDDY KRUGER? WHAT A LIGHTWEIGHT. EAT YA HEART OUT, PIZZA-FACE! GO BACK TO DOMINO'S.


I think I speak for everyone here (who isn't a zombie) when I hail this game as not only the most outstanding survival horror title to lurch out of the woodwork this side of REmake, but arguably the greatest game in the entire horror genre (and inarguably one of the greatest games of all time). While I'm almost 100% sure it will be proclaimed GOTY, even this seems like too insufficient an accolade for such a stone-cold, blood-curdling masterpiece. In all honesty I think ""Game of the Decade"", or perhaps even ""GOOG"" (Game of our Generation), would be a more fitting honour to bestow upon this blood-soaked slice of pure genius! Resident Evil 2 is the kind of groundbreaking, genre-defining (and REdefining) bottle of lightning that could actually change the course of gaming history ‚Äì much like RE4 did some 14 years ago.

How should be Remakes? Like Resident Evil 1 (Gamecube) Remake. But Capcom can even better. This is an epic remake of an good game, most of the remake is in it, but they change so many of it on other places. There are a few things to find like many letters/ messages. You can decide a part of your ammo, do you want pistol, shotgun or magnum ammo, if you be smart you can make it to your advantage. The game is like all Resident Evil games if you know how to play very short, than there are a few extra modes. There are a few things that are challenging like 4 Survivor, playing on Veteran with only 3 Saves, only small inventory vs strong eniemes & less ammo in a very short time or to beat all other challenges of the game like the 4 mode (what would be when) with the Sheriff kill 100 Enemies with only 60 pistol bullets & special equipment, what you get, i need over 200 shoots & barely made it. So if people want they can find a lot of stuff. The B Scenarios are okay, new puzzles, but there could be a bit more changes, but after i all i love this game & its worth to play.

I give it 95 % & maybe its not so long like Resident Evil 4, there could be more meetings from Claire/ Leon (like S.T.A.R.S office) but its fine. I hope you enjoy like me.",Recommended," April 13, 2019"

Resident Evil 2 has always been one of my favourite games and I have been waiting for a Remake for many years.

It was absolutely worth the wait.

The Resident Evil team are currently going through a colossal redemption arc for the series, starting with RE7. The amount of passion and effort put into this game is nothing short of incredible. The same spirit of the original game is here throughout, with plenty of changes in gameplay and level design as to not be a quick cash-in. They could have simply re-created everything from the original in a 3d environment, but had too much passion to do it this way. You can tell that this is how they wanted the original game to play out, and thanks to improvements in technology they can deliver it.

I don't feel that anything in this game overstays its welcome, or is dragged out to increase gameplay time for the sake of it. My first playthroughs for Claire A/Leon B took 8.5 and 7 hours respectively. As both stories play out in the same locations with a handful of differences, this is not the game for people who only play through games once and live by the $/hour model. This is very much a game that caters to the original audience who enjoy good pacing, tension, sensible backtracking, and multiple playthroughs. Inventory management is still as crucial as ever, and doesn't feel like a burden bringing the experience down.

Everybody owes it to themselves to experience this game and the atmosphere it creates.",Recommended," February 10, 2019"
220,Jessica‚ô•,"
To preface, there is a lot of good about this game, but I need to tell you it's shortcomings. While the gameplay is excellent, and the game is something like 3 times longer than the original, there is a real lack of context. a lot of the files that we had in the orginal and text descriptions of things we could inspect, are all gone from this. This makes the world feel empty and less lived in. It's a real shame.

the worst part though is how capcom handled the two stories of the original. basically they're gone. this game is one story. except for some bizarre reason, you have to play the same game twice, once for sherry's sections and again for ada's sections (which are ironically different in this remake while they were identical in the original) and the proper ending.
aside from those things, the game is pretty much exactly the same for both. mr X was even pulled from mission B and put into all scenarios.

This was a big disappointment. I was expecting to get a new B scenario with an enemy and events that did not happen in my first playthrough. instead i got the A scenario of the other character and an extra boss at the end. This was so disappoiunting that I just feel the need to warn other potential players.

I don't recommend this if you want 2 scenarios and The rich backstory we came to expect. only buy it if you want an exciting single story with great gameplay and environments and don't nmind being forced to play it all again to get your full ending.",Not Recommended," January 28, 2019"

Gameplay: 7.5\10

- Challenge:

The game offers a good challenge during your first approach at it (granted you play in hardcore mode), homever it gets really easy in your successive playthroughs, as you will have memorized puzzle solutions, items locations, enemies encounters and map routes.



The content is good, but it certainly isn't long, especially if you don't care about achievements, in-game records and unlockables. I 100%'d it in 26 hours, unlocking every record, concept art and models.



Thanks to the beautiful locations, graphics and sounds, the immersion in this game is awesome, especially if played in the dark with a good headset.



Great and intuitive controls for fast and accurate actions.





The graphics and art design are gorgeous (see screenshots), with many settings to work around with if you have a less powerful PC. Honestly I don't remember playing any better graphics game than this.



The soundtrack is nothing memorable (except for the 4th Survivor music, that one is really awesome), the voice acting is average. The overall ambient and enemies sounds on the other hand are incredibly immersive and realistic. You will feel anxious most of the time.

The best hits mixtape
When Resident Evil 2 Remake was first announced it immediately drew the attention of the gaming world. After breathing new life into the franchise with RE 7, Capcom once again chose to go big. Instead of a mere HD Remaster, a treatment which the first RE had already seen, the studio chose to remake the game from scratch. The result is a critically acclaimed blockbuster of a game. When examined more closely, RE 2 Remake turns out to be a patchwork of all the best ideas the franchise have had during its over 20 years-long run. It‚Äôs a narcissistic self-tribute, made with deliberate attention and care necessary to sew all the pieces together into a smooth, coherent whole. The result is something much bigger than the mere sum of its parts. Let‚Äôs try and examine each one of them below.

Fear of the unknown
As RE 7 already made evident, the ‚ÄúREach for the moon‚Äù engine is capable of rendering stunning visuals. It was only improved upon for the RE 2 Remake release and the game is simply beautiful in its dour, dim colour palette. Especially the cutscenes can be breathtaking, which also provides a perfect tool for delivering a personal character-centred narrative. Cinematic intrusions are used scarcely, not to break the immersion and instead highlight the characters and emphasise the atmosphere. The effect is powerful enough for the first third of RE 2 to be genuinely scary. Which is an astounding success for a game drawing foremost from zombie flicks.

During the very first zombie encounter, the player is already made painfully aware that they are woefully unprepared to face the danger head-on. Search for the answers that takes you to Racoon city makes it blatant that things had spiralled out of control. As you take your first steps into the poorly-lit interiors of Racoon City‚Äôs Police Department, search becomes a struggle for survival, as it gets scary to take a simple peek behind the corner. The game perfectly plays off the early fear of the unknown to get the player fully invested into the fate of their chosen protagonist. By the time you get accustomed to the game enough to grow bolder, those early horror moments will have you hooked in proper.


In RE 4 Capcom introduced a then-new, more action-oriented approach to gameplay. Facilitated mostly through ‚Äúover the shoulder‚Äô camera perspective, the game was filled with intense close- quarters firefights. The studio seemingly enjoyed the formula so much that (for better or worse) two more games followed this direction, never quite achieving the success that RE 4 had. RE 2 remake revisits this idea and makes it reach its full potential once more. Every fight in the game requires the player to carefully balance between running and shooting. The player is required to be fully immobile in order to reach the best accuracy but staying in one place for too long is an easy way to get overrun. Naturally, every shot counts as ammunition is always low and most enemies tear a third of your health in one bite. The shoulder-camera perspective also fits best for the portrayal of a zombie horde coming from all sides. Once you see outstretched hands missing your back by a hair‚Äôs breadth, you will know what I mean.

However clunky, for the franchise standards, RE 2 remake has probably the most fluent third-person shooting the series has seen yet. The choice of weapons isn‚Äôt exactly wide, albeit Claire and Leon have a separate arsenal to further diversify the gameplay between the two. Once you get a hang of the movement, adapt to the zombies‚Äô jerky shambling and learn that nothing quite stays dead in Racoon city, the game at large stops being scary. Instead, the game exudes pressure by introducing an unstoppable force ‚Äì Mr X, a humanoid behemoth that will remove any false sense of security from the equation. The entry of the Tyrant serves as a turning point, at which RE 2 shifts its focus onto more action and releases a wider variety of series‚Äô trademark grotesque monsters.


Feeling of being perpetually hounded never quite stops in RE 2. That said, there are multiple calmer sequences allowing the player to catch a breath. Many of those moments are spent solving puzzles, the second thing series is best-known for. The puzzles are often weird and entirely irrational, they require you to think but are easy enough as to not stall you for too long. They manage to take the player‚Äôs mind off things, relax and just barely let their guard down so that the next punch can sink in properly. A punch likely delivered by a 3-meter tall miscreant with eyes in all the wrong places. Part of each puzzle is finding the proper place to use the key items and managing inventory. RE 2 remake still has some backtracking and requires a little equipment-tetris, though as far as the quality of life goes, it is the most welcoming Resident Evil up to date. The items fit into equipment on their own stacking and combining nicely and many game sections ‚Äúshut off‚Äù the player as to make getting lost more difficult. Much like in mansion from the first RE, RE 2 remake has he player run in circles throughout the police department, gradually gaining entry to further and further rooms. Puzzles overall successfully provide diversity to the gameplay, so that it never gets dull throughout the campaign.


Alas, this is why I consider Resident Evil 2 remake a best hits tape - mixing quirky puzzles, RE 4 combat, RE 7 visuals and narrative and having all those grafted to RE 2, the best-received of the first three games, serving as a foundation. Having said all that, the game does bring new toys to the table too. Foremost RE 2 commits to making the most of the series‚Äô dual protagonist formula. Claire and Leon have their respective subplot. You even get to play a segment as secondary characters, all so that the complete story can only be witnessed by playing the game twice. The game goes to great lengths to get the player to run it the second time, a little too far for my taste. You see, the ending is ‚Äúcut‚Äù on the first playthrough and the player is informed that they have to play as the other protagonist to get the full picture. This rather cheap trick is probably my biggest complaint, as the game already has a prefect replayability, complete even with ‚Äú2nd run‚Äù campaign variant, giving the seasoned players a head start into the game.

This is but a tiny dent in otherwise spectacular game. RE 2 does require you to suspend disbelief a lot to truly get invested into it. Yet, that quirky aspect of the game is so integral to the franchise identity that I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. So naturally, if I come across an ornamental office plant, I will shove it flowerpot-first into my face. It was green, there is no way it won‚Äôt be good for your health.

Resident Evil 2 is an absolutely brilliant game. It can be easily recommended to all survival-horror fans, as this is the franchise that has shaped its sub-genre. Make no mistake, it‚Äôs a Resident Evil game and the survival part does eventually overtake the horror. Luckily, the title doesn‚Äôt let go without setting the tone properly first. Long story short, if you were to choose a single game from the franchise, RE 2 is your best bet. Especially that while playing it you will experience, in a sense, the legacy of the entire series. All neatly compacted into a 15 hours-long (assuming both runs) gourmet survival-horror package. Grab your flashlight and make each one of these shots count.",Recommended, April 13

Feel free to follow my review page!

The gist of it:
Resident Evil 2 Remake is a third person shooter horror game and a good example of how a remake should be done but not without some issues that just don't click with modern times.

üëç The good parts:
+Fantastic atmosphere
+Character models are great
+Guns and overall gunplay feels nice
+Despite cheesy/average writing the actors do a good job at voicing the characters.
+Sound design

üëéThe bad parts:
-The story even after you get the true ending is average and it shows its age
-Inventory management
-Weak environmental physics, try to shoot a bottle or through glass does nothing for example.
-Having to replay the game again and go through the same key puzzles but with different placements to get to the true ending is very tedious and most of the times makes no sense with what you did previously with the first character.

The game is a remake of a 1998 game and sadly the story will feel very cheesy or average, nothing we have not seen over the years in horror games. A virus, zombies, 2 protagonists that get caught in the aftermath, a secret corporation that tests multiple viruses for world domination, other secret parties that want the virus for themselves, overpowered creatures, it's all there. The problem with a remake, even if it's perfectly done, you simply will not be able to surprise fans or people who have already played the old games. On the other hand, new fans of the series may find the story mysterious and interesting even with its cheesy classic writing.

The story allows you to experience the story from 2 points of views each having mostly similar stories. Sadly in order to get to the true ending, you have to play a second time with the other character having to go through all the puzzles and locations all over again but with a different starting point and item/puzzle placements. This could've been great if they showed the story from the second person's perspective in parallel with what you did with the first character. Sadly that is not the case, everything you unlocked and did previously is locked again, puzzles included. On one hand, it does allow you to have a challenging long 2nd run but on the other hand, it makes no sense from a timeline/story perspective and it just feels tedious and boring, for me at least. I could not go through the 2nd run again entirely. The true ending is hardly worth it but it is a proper ending anyway so feel free to look it up if you feel exhausted doing all the things again in the 2nd run.

Story rating: 7/10

I truly disliked the fixed camera from the previous remasters and classic games and I'm super glad they decided to go with the third person. It also increases the horror aspect more, at least in my opinion though not as much as it were in first person view.

As with all third-person horror games, you have to progress through a series of claustrophobic environments and deal with the zombies and monsters you encounter. The guns you acquire are great and feel great to shoot as well. You can even upgrade them further to help you in dealing with tougher enemies.

Besides the typical survival shooting the game also has a lot of environmental puzzles. In order to advance you have to find specific keys which go into specific locks which are placed all around the level masterfully. It may seem overwhelming at first with all manner of locked doors however the map is incredibly useful. It shows you what rooms you have explored fully what type of lock is in a room you have not explored what objects you did not pick and many more.

The only negative aspect of the gameplay and it's something I hate in mostly all Resident Evil Games and that is the annoying inventory system. It's a very outdated system in which you have very limited space, you are not able to swap items you find in the world with what you have on you, nor can you drop items which can make some puzzles a chore to keep going back and forth to your box to drop and grab what you need among many other small negatives that keep piling up. No nicer way to put it, it's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Some like it and I guess that's why they keep using it. In a sense, the inventory is a puzzle, which fits with the whole gameplay. I still dislike it.

Gameplay rating: 8.5/10

The audio design is surprisingly really fantastic. Voice acting may sound cheesy but that's due to the weak/classic writing. The actors do a good job portraying their characters.

Environmental audio is quite well done, as you can hear zombie growls and specific footsteps of a certain individual around the level that just panics you whenever you're close to him or them.

The soundtrack fits well with the horror and it's never too annoying or very loud. The rest of the sound effects are all decent.

Audio rating: 9/10

The developers did an amazing job remaking the environments, as they look quite nice from an artistic point of view. Level design is great, never too confusing or hard and everything just falls nicely into place while exploring the maps.

All the characters in the game have superb details, shadows are quite nice, the textures are quite detailed though not every single one and the lighting sets the mood perfectly.

Sadly they had to cut some other things due to budget, time or just being lazy and that is the environmental physics. Everything around you is mostly static. Try to shoot a bottle or a book on a desk? Nothing happens. You can't move chairs or anything else. Most of the times it feels like you're playing a 2D game in a 3D environment. It hides it well but not all the times. Puzzles are also not real time, which emphasizes what I said.

From a performance point of view, the game runs smoothly. To summarize quickly I ran the game at 1440p with a GTX 1070 at around 80-100 FPS with most settings at max with the exception of shadows and lighting which really offer no difference between the max setting and the one below it. Those two settings at max seem to eat a ton of frames on my system while visually there were no perceivable differences so if you're on a weaker system lower those settings a notch.

I have not encountered any game breaking bug and surprisingly not even minor ones.

Graphics, performance and tech analysis rating: 8.5/10

I'm quite impressed with the remake and this is coming from someone who dislikes the franchise and might be biased against it. Not much else to be said, in my opinion even if you're not a Resident Evil fan, I still recommend the game and hopefully with its success the third entry and hopefully the next ones will get some form of remake into full survival horror and less action ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t that RE6 gave us.",Recommended," February 3, 2019"

After 18 years of begging it's finally here.


The main problem with this remake is that it's narratively incompetent. Completely. They cut out several cutscenes from the original game that were key to the plot, but they continued to develop the plot of the remake based on these cutscenes that never happened. It shouldn't take you long to notice the story is literally worse than the original. You'll see what I mean.

There's no genius of design here. This doesn't elevate game design or the series to any new level. Literally this is the equivalent of if they put in over the shoulder aiming in REmake 1, except they added silly modern horror mechanics like being chased by an invincible adversary. It's a tired horror trope at this point which dates back to Nemesis and other games like Silent Hill 2 and Haunting Ground and it's not only overused , but now they've jumped the shark and ruined it for RE3 remake which is the game where Nemesis SHOULD be stalking you all the time.

The tyrant can pop up at any time, any place, even if makes absolutely no sense. Yet there are also rooms he can't go in besides save rooms. This is especially bad in 4th Survivor where he literally warps in front of you. It makes for an interesting challenge because, in the normal campaigns, all those lickers and zombies you left alive - the Tyrant is going to push you into them. Good luck.

They've cut out tons of content from the original game, not just scenes that were cucial to the narrative but enemies and locations and rooms too. There are no super lickers, no naked lab zombies, very few lab zombies period, no ivy plants (technically), no moth, no spiders. And everyone's favorite sequence - the giant alligator - is a page directly from the ""Worst Designs in RE History"" playbook. Think RE6 when you are running towards the camera from the Ustanak and can't see what you're running in to.

Despite all of that, REmake 2 is almost good enough to make up for the fact that Capcom ONLY catered this game towards new players and RE4 era fans. With original soundtrack DLC it even brings back the old menu sounds like I asked for.

Many new puzzles have been added, and older puzzles moved around or changed, but, they're almost too easy. Most of them are too easy I'd say. Gameplay harkens back to the original, with multiple scenarios, arrange mode, Hunk and Tofu, etc, but there is no A/B scenario this itime around. At least it isn't named that way, and what you do in the first playthrough doesn't affect the second.

Overall I'd say they did a great job of recreating most of the games locations, while making them still interesting, but they've sterilized essentially all of the charm of the real RE2. The intro sequence has been significantly changed, along with some of the best dialog being removed, and in fact they actually made the game MORE cheesy. The game is beautiful with a robust array of graphics options that most PC exclusives don't even have, much less multiplats. You may encounter some massive stuttering - this is caused by enabling . Either turn it off, or alt tab and disable your internet adapter then go back to the game. Doing it once should fix the game forever, it worked for me anyway. After circumventing the ridiculous problems it runs buttery smooth.

Ultimately, if you were a fan of the original, this remake is little more than a museum to RE2. It's fun to see what they did but it pales in comparison to playing RE2. If you're a new fan, this is worth it as you're not going to find a new title closer to the original gangster than this besides RE7.,",Recommended," January 27, 2019"

When you play the 2nd run (which doesn't come close to anything like the B scenarios from the original game) you start noticing the flaws right away, the only good things are gameplay variations and few scenes that hint at a consistent storyline, the inconsistency becomes wild and obvious when you reach the main hall by any of the two characters, repetitive boss fights, puzzles, etc... it doesn't even try hard.

Hell even the Rebecca easter egg seems like a last minute addition, its just an unproportional lame edit of the RE0 HD render of that costume.

As a result of some stupid ""realistic"" decisions taken on this game (which people were generally fine with), RE3 remake will be much more unfaithful and drastic which hurts my soul as it's my favorite game.

The only reason this game is getting too much credit is because of hype and the fact people were desperate for a survival horror RE game, or just survival horror in general. Sure I love that this is back too but this should've been a decent remake as well, it's not just the survival horror essence - it needed to be a good, faithful remake that doesn't remove and replace, but adds and improves.",Not Recommended," December 14, 2019"

Phenomenal game, IMO one of the better remakes out there. The overall spirit of the original game is still intact with its weaknesses ironed out and its strenghts polished. There's a much bigger emphasis on survival and route planning compared to the original game, and much like the RE1 remake a number of enemies/scenarios have been completely reworked for the better, making it an experience that is fresh for newcomers and players of the original alike.

The A/B scenario differences aren't as fleshed out as they could have been, but I think it's a minor issue as the game succeeds incredibly well on almost every other point. Between RE7 and this, it feels like Capcom is right back on track with the series and I can't wait to see what else they'll do going forwards.",Recommended," February 14, 2019"

A mostly faithful recreation of Resident Evil 2 with gameplay which reminds me of Resident Evil: Revelations 1 (minus the melee moves and the endless hordes of Hunters). I found fighting the zombies a bit tedious in the long run (most combat encounters can be beaten by backing away slowly while shooting zombies with seemingly endless bullets), and the game's level design becomes much too linear at the halfway point. Mr X, who stalks you during a major portion of the game, adds a new sense of tension but he's annoying whenever you want to be left alone to finish a puzzle.

On the flipside, there many positives I can mention: the graphics are really impressive and performance more so, the game feels extremely polished, the weapons feel satisfying to use, and the police station is fun to explore. I personally wished they had doubled down on classic RE or action RE, rather than something which feels halfway between the two, but I enjoyed this a lot more than RE7, and I'm very curious to see how the RE3 remake improves on this template.",Recommended, February 25

TL;DR: Just buy it, it's the apex of survival horror, period.
This is survival horror at its best. Top-notch graphics, very well optimized, amazing controls, and a lot of challenge & scares - even for a veteran of the serie like myself. It was well worth the wait. It manages to be a better Remake than RE1's remake was, and that's no small feat.

It is more of a survival-horror than the original RE2 was (Yeah 'cuz RE2 onward you had enough stock to kill every ennemy, let's be real). While I really loved RE7 and its First Person perspective, RE2's Third-Person is amazing. I would have liked a (native) first person mode like TEW2 did though.

Playing in Hardcore difficulty mode is a must. Otherwise you get something more like a zombie shooting gallery which isn't the experience you'll be playing through.

Now let's hope Cashcom doesn't remake all the old games without making new, numbered entries.

Just finished the game for the first time. It doesnt dissapoint one bit. Its the best ""modern"" resident evil in my oppinion. The game is amazingly balanced, that you value every bullet and herb you get, making you feel a constant danger of losing your means to survive. The game even makes generic overused enemies like Zombies feel scary in such situations. If a game nowadays still can make you fear zombies. It does horror survival right.

So the first playthrough took me 6hours, which unlocks an alternative playthrough for the other character. Giving the player the option play through the games 4 times with varation to the story and progression. Though the main difference is between the ""2nd Run"" and ""standard"" one. The are still slight differences between leon and claire. So the games offers around 12h~ if you just want to play the story once and 18~20 if you want to see everything excluding the extra modes.

Even though others games may offer more playtime. The experience you get in those hours could only be rivaled by very few games.",Recommended," January 25, 2019"

As a big fan of the series and after the amazing return to greatness that was Resident Evil 7 I was cautiously excited about the remake of Resident Evil 2. However I did not expect to be blown away by one of the best ""remastered "" games I have ever played. The game is absolutely incredible on every level and manages to play even better than the original. The use of the updated Resident Evil 7 engine and the change of camera perspective really helps to give everything a new feel while still being the great game it originally was. One unexpected surprise was despite familiar moments I remembered from playing through Resident Evil 2 before there seemed to be some changes to key locations and cut scenes (admittedly though it has been a long time). This game is a reminder of just how truly great a survival horror game can be. You walk around never knowing what's next and swearing that you finally took out an enemy only to be surprised when they aren't quite done yet. The Tyrant enemy is at times frustrating, annoying and amazing. But nothing feels more incredible then when you are panicking while trying to truly aim yourself as multiple zombies approach. A head shot in a game has never felt so frustratingly satisfying especially when you only take off a piece of their head and they keep coming. My plan is to play through with every character (I believe 4 have playthroughs) accessible to get as much of the story as possible and in a true testament to this game I can not wait to see how each play through differs and tells more of the story. After playing this I hope the rumors of a remastered version of Resident Evil Nemesis and Code Veronica are true because if they put the same level of effort in then we will have more modernized classics to enjoy!",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

I cannot express how amazing this game is, it totally exceeded my expectations, I haven't even finished it yet and it's still ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing good. I stopped playing for a few days because I feel like I'm already finishing Leon's campaign and I don't want it to end that fast.

I'm a long time fan that always wanted a fixed camera Remake 2 just like RE 0 and Remake but the over the shoulder camera is perfect for this game, I still would like a fixed camera dlc or at least a free update to see how it would look like but I doubt they would put that much of an effort just for that, also would be awesome to get a first person camera dlc just to see how it looks like that.

But damn, this is a great game and I'm crossing my fingers for a Code Veronica Remake, and I don't say Remake 3 because let's be honest, they already have lot of stuff made for a Remake 3 and I think they will do it since people are loving the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of this one, but I totally would prefer Code Veronica first over 3.

Somethings I liked about the game:
-Lickers are very spooky and buffed.
-Mr. X has a fedora.
-Doggos are scary.
-Ada is waifu.

Things I don't like:
-Have to pay for classic soundtrack. :(
-Claire's classic outfit unlock is not identical to the the original.

EA: people aren't interested in single player games
Capcom: Hold my beer

Now then... THIS is the proper way to do a remake! you instantly feel at home as a returning RE2 fan and yet it's a completely different experience at the same time, amazing graphics and atmosphere that just drips off everything you can see, and most of what you can see is terrifying. This is everything a survival horror game should be and a real testimony to how with some care a much-loved game classic can be refreshed and made terrifying all over again for a new generation!

The enemies are terrifying and dangerous and the pacing is good to keep you moving with a good blend of puzzle solving, exploration and combat.

I think the only thing that I feel could have been better is the gunplay in that with the new over the shoulder combat system, you can aim quite well and yet it can take sometimes 8 bullets to the head to kill a single zombie. I would have much prefered to be rewarded for that accuracy of headshots with 1 or 2 shots to take one down, but with less ammo. Ammo sponge enemies for me spoil games, however, RE2 has enough going for it that it remains an incredible experience.

It's definitely a 9/10 for me and would have been a 10 if the gunplay was a little better with more realistic damage from headshots.",Recommended," January 26, 2019"
253,MrMuse,"
Wow.

This serves as an object lesson to every ""remaster"" out there. The remastered version of RE 'one' was nice but, let's face it, it was mainly a graphical overhaul. Resident Evil 2, however, is a complete remake rather than some half hearted revamp. It takes the original story, characters, and settings and completely overhauls them from the ground up. It adds the superior over the shoulder camera of later versions as opposed to the original messy camera. The graphics are absolutely 2019 and beautifully done, and they have added enough jump scares and tweaks and changes that it will feel fresh enough to anyone who completed the original way back when. I'm not sure we needed typwriter save points (and ribbons on hardcore mode) on a pc but the rest is so well done that this is a very minor point by comparison.

No lazy profiteering to be seen here folks, take a seat and enjoy the ride or go back to whatever sickly sweet thing you were playing before you got here because, as a remake, this is the best I've ever seen.

Now please update 'one' to be like this and free to anyone who paid for the remaster and then remake every other Resident Evil like it as well. Start with 4 because everyone knows 4 is the best. 91%",Recommended," January 27, 2019"

‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in' great RE2 remake all around the board.

- it runs perfectly on the engine, which was also used by RE7
- graphics are beautiful
- audio/sound design is perfect
- absolutely compelling storyline
- one of the best, if not, the best zombies in any game.
- super detailed (shadows, lightning, sounds/ambient, enemies reacting to your attacks realistically, etc.)
- enough content to spend a lot of time on
- ton of puzzles while also maintaining a perfect amount of action
- keeps true to the original resident evil 2
- controls are pretty nice
- actually the most wholesome ending (true ending, beating A & B)

my only complaints:
- some clunky facial animations at times.
- stories feel a lot more short once you get an understanding on the game, and/or after beating first time or after a few times. (only 3 stages: RPD, Sewers, NEST)
- not enough leon/claire interactions as opposed to original

no regrets pre-ordering this flawless remake by capcom. :*)",Recommended," February 16, 2019"

Absolutely the best remake of a game i have ever played. I have played all the resident evil games on many different platforms over the years and i am a huge fan. I can honestly say that I am impressed how well this remake has been done. i loved the original and i love this one just as much if not more because of all the updated gameplay mechanics and graphics. Any resident evil fan or survival horror fan MUST play this game. Also, I have almost 23 hrs and I havent even finished the scenareo A for Claire. I have both B scenareos still to go once i do. so there are definitely many hours of play in this game. Worth every penny spent to buy it. I can only hope now they will remake RE3 and Code veronica next. If they do, they will most certainly be getting my money. This game is a definite 10/10.",Recommended," January 28, 2019"

A masterclass piece of the survival horror genre.

Resident Evil 2 took a lot of cues from the original game and built upon its various strengths to deliver a (subjectively) superior experience during the PSX 1998 era. These days we have RE2make to usher in an entirely new generation to experience what is still to many an all-time classic. This remake is not only faithful to the original but somewhat of an expanded version as many of the returning treats and surprises are rebuilt from the ground up to support the new gameplay perspective of an over-the-shoulder camera. Alongside the extra free DLC updates that Capcom has planned for the coming months, I wholeheartedly recommend picking up this game and showing your support to the Resident Evil development team that they have created something truly special.

Going through your first run of this remake is an incredible experience. I'm an OG Resi fan, having played Resident Evil 2 when it first came out in the late 90s. It was perhaps my favourite Resident Evil for years, so I had a hard time imagining Capcom could possibly do the game justice. Even more so when I heard this is a reimagining that doesn't even have fixed camera angles anymore. I was wrong. Capcom has done the original game justice alright. They released an intense, visually beautiful and mechanically sound modern survival horror game that sets new standards.

I'm not going to say the game is perfect. It's not. A glaring flaw for instance, at least once you play it long enough, is the limited nature of the B scenario. For those that don't know, the game has two protagonists, if you pick one to start with, that's called a scenario A, once finished you can play with the other character as a scenario B, supposedly showing what the other character was doing all this time. In the original game the B scenarios felt a lot more complementary to their A counterparts. And also Claire A/Leon B, ie the canonical route, was different to Leon A/Claire B. Here the routes are virtually identical. Even the differences between scenario A and B are very limited. Basically a different prologue/epilogue and item placing.

But even if the game lacks the replayability of the original, it matters little. As mentioned earlier, the first run through this game is absolutely fantastic and worth playing. I recommend this game to all fans of the Resident Evil series and survival horror. It is a must. If you don't have the patience to go through all the repetitive routes, I recommend Claire A/Leon B. Even though it is not really the canonical one anymore, since the continuity is problematic and the other route is basically the same. The character interactions still feel more right.",Recommended, April 14

When Capcom Announced Resident Evil 2 Remake, I was very excited and also worried.I didn't know if the game is going to complete what Capcom started in 2017 and make the series great again or it's going to be another nail in the RE series coffin. After I played the one-shot demo, I was sure that this game is going to be a a great game. After I played the game for the first time, I was shocked because it was so enjoyable. It was something between the original RE2 and RE4. It really is a Survivor-horror game. In my first Playthrough, I wasted a lot of ammo to kill all the zombies and Lickers and after a while, I didn't have any ammo and I had to begin from the beginning of the game. RE2 is really scary and hard, you may shoot a zombie 3 times and it falls on the ground but it might not be dead and it might wake up and attack you next time you are near it. After a while, you meet Mr.X, a Tyrant which chase you throughout the police station and you can't kill it. However,the game has some issues. First of all, Voice acting of some characters isn't good. Another problem is that unlike the original game, Different Scenarios are not as different as I expected. In conclusion, Resident Evil 2 Remake is one the of the best games in the series and one of the best survivor-horror games of all time.

I really have no complain at all for this game tbh since i almost can't find any cons. Capcom really outdid theirselves for the several times right now. The original game is already a masterpiece. And they basically made a reborn of the original to create a masterpiece in a different form. This game is sure a homage to survival horror lovers. If you're a fan of survival horror games then this game is sure one of those must plays. You'll not regret it even at the full price since this game has a lot of replaybility also.

Masterclass!!! Capcom have done it again!!

Although I personally don't think the actual story being told is as good as resident evil 7's, it's still a ridiculously good game nonetheless worthy of all its praise and then some. Seriously, this is one of the best games of this generation imo and the best remake of pretty much any game made at this point. I doubt Square Enix's FF 7 will beat it or any other for that matter, in a long time.

With graphics that sometimes come close to photo-realism, free DLC that they could've easily charged for like in Resident evil 7 and a remake that stays as close to the original as they possibly could while adding a few nitbits here and there. Ladies and gentlemen, this is pretty much close to utter perfection for a remake as it can possibly get. Actual replay value with you needing to complete the game twice once each for Leon and Claire for the complete story experience, the 2nd run for each character adding in sequences and different scenarios and hiding in reward bonuses such as weapons for doing quests while on a play through for you to still get enjoyment repeating the story again. There isn't much to say here except that its an instant buy for anyone who's into these types of games and if you don't get it and you happen to be a fan of horror, you are doing a disservice to yourself.

Although the original soundtrack I believe should've been in the base game but unlike the holy trinity (EA, Activision and Bethesda) Capcom on the other hand actually make quality games which cant be said entirely for the trinity.

My score for this game is a ROCK hard SOLID 9/10 with permission to buy BLINDLY!! Although it is slow paced, the game is a remake of a game made in the 90's and criticising its pacing wouldn't be a critique of the remake but a critique of the original since the remake just serves the purpose of modernising the original title still keeping the original intact which they did flawlessly.

Even the damn port is spectacular with me encountering LITERALLY not a single bug in my 2 playthrough's I've played so far, random hitches on resident evil 7 I had being completely omitted from this title, noticeable low res textures being completely replaced with close to photo-realism at times and customisation rival to none with them actually showing in-game how the setting would look if it was turned on without having to go in-game to judge that. Everything down to the lighting was done spectacularly and done better than res 7, also the surround sound and deep 3D audio for headphones definitely added to the immersion and I would recommend you to go out and buy some headphones just for res 7 and 2 while cranking the volume close to maximum to make it really feel more like your actually in Leon's/Clair's shoes.

RESIDENT EVIL IS BACK!!!!! Never seen a group of devs completely turn themselves around like this, lets just hope they keep this up. If Capcom keep this up with them constantly pumping out amazing titles one after the other, maybe EA will take notes realising single player games aren't dead and bring back some of their beloved titles they've rammed through the mud.

Make Zombies Scary Again

Resident Evil 2 remake stays true to the slow and haunting experience of the original game, but also modern enough so that it doesn't feel old at all.

The graphics are amazing - the engine is able to produce a very detailed picture while offering a very robust menu to customize it. Best part is that you can actually see the way every slider affects the screen on a nifty preview.

The sound design is absolutely stellar - the soundscape feels alive between those booming steps of Mr. X chasing you (don't forget to turn on the binaural stereo effects in the menu!) and characters muttering under their breath ""You got this"".

The controls have been reworked in a very special way, giving you much more freedom than the old ""tank controls"", but still retaining that feeling of uneasiness and weight.

All in all - the game is an easy contender to the ""Game of the Year Award"", and a must have for every gamer!

Don't know how it compares to original RE2, but on it's own the remake is a good survival horror game. It makes you think and plan ahead, which is more than i can say about majority of the games out there today. Horror atmosphere is very strong for the most part, only gets kinda old at the end. Fairly optimized for a capcom game, but i had some fps drops here and there. And generally looks good, but they really doubled down on ugly, blurry effects (i guess to mask the low res textures). Thankfully you can turn that crap off in the options before your eyes start to melt. And there are reshades that can make the tint look less ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• yellow.

Felt great playing it and i'd say it's worth getting.

Also Dolph Lundgren did an amazing job portraying Mr. X.",Recommended," March 3, 2019"

Resident Evil 2 Remake is the game all of us 30 something year old Gen Xers have been waiting for. It takes the greatest and most definitive Resident Evil game in the entire franchise and shapes it in to something that is too good for us mere mortals... it is damn near perfection and the game us true RE fans deserve.

Sorry, But It Looks Like Your Party Has Been Cancelled

Well here it is boils and ghouls, it's arrived, it was made with time, love and tenderness. We wouldn't even be here right now if it wasn't for some outside help from a group of true die hard fans, that Capcom hired on to the project, and it shows 200%.

RE2 has a place in my heart, it was the first RE game I ever played way back on the original PSX and it was love at first sight. I never imagined video gaming could evolve to that level back in 1998, it was like playing a movie (I thought at the time)... The crazy part is the remake recaptures this exact same feeling all over again and IT....IS.....BLISSSSSSS. I'm back to my old self again just like one of those fat old useless kings in Super Mario Bros. 3.

We as fans finally put a kibosh to the nonsense direction this franchise was going in and I for one couldn't be happier. We've finally broken through to the marketing ""geniuses"" at Capcom, our words were spoken, our voice was heard and Capcom delivered. If I had to endure another garbage game like Resident Evil 7 I would have literally wrote this series off completely but they've revived it once again and hopefully it's here to stay.


So this remake is basically just that, a remake of our beloved RE2. If you came in to this expecting a REmaster like the original Gamecube REmake of Resident Evil 1 then you're going to be disappointed, they've changed a lot.

There are similarities between the original PSX version but as a whole, they used a lot of ideas they originally had from the prototype of RE2, also known as RE1.5 by internet standards. The R.P.D. generally has the same structure but there's some new areas and a slew of new puzzles to figure out. The game's changed enough to keep old fans guessing but not to the point where the game will seem completely unfamiliar and a mere shadow of it's former self... No, they've improved on just about everything structure wise.

The game play is also a lot more technical and actually requires skill, accuracy and strategy. No longer will you equip the appropriate weapon, auto target the nearest enemy that's completely out of sight and just hit the shoot button to dispose of them... you have to dodge, re-position, aim and have patience to deal the most damage possible to advancing enemies.

Lickers are actually a threat in this game, Mr. X (Tyrant) will follow you and harass you relentlessly this time around, so no more scripted fights, this is the real deal. Standard mode is fairly basic and anyone with some semblance of gaming skill can beat it easily but Hardcore is for true masochists. If you plan on unlocking all the goodies you're going to have to pull out all the stops and focus your energy with zero interruptions. Good Luck!

The Ada and Sherry sections of the game have also been expanded on and give the player a whole new unique experience with them. Their sections are a lot more fun to play through this time around, especially Sherry's as it's a shift in tension... truly terrifying.


So without spoiling too much, this game is a must buy for any real Resident Evil fan, if you loved the tension and horror of the original with a little mix of action then this is the proper game for you. If you're sick of the main characters shooting off 27 shotgun blasts in a row without reloading and cartwheeling through laser beams then this is also a game you need in your life.

It goes back to the roots of the franchise and brings back the tension and scares, a true survival horror game where item management is just as important as knowing how to handle your opponent.



+ Everything you want in a Remake
+ Amazing graphics
+ Dialog and voice acting are top shelf
+ Plot has been improved upon but not changed to drastic levels
+ Game play is solid and right where it needs to be to create a high level of stress
+ Amazing optimisation on PC, runs like melting butter.
+ Incredibly challenging and fun to git gud at
+ Original RE2 OST can be purchased and swapped for old school fans
+ DLC costumes are actually good
+ Hunk & Tofu mini games are back and Tofu's has been expanded for the better.
+ Hardcore mode is no joke



- No Crows
- No cheesy one liners at the end
- Infinite Weapons are locked behind demanding skill prerequisites


So final thoughts, it's a 9.8 out of 10. It's lacking just a few things to make it a perfect game, because again nothing is perfect but it's damn near close and it's the beginning of a beautiful rekindled relationship with a long lost friend. You need to go buy this game and support it, and here's hoping we'll see Nemesis in new age graphical glory in a few short years.

Best RE Games to date! It's been a while since I enjoyed RE games since RE Outbreak, RE 2 and RE3 (That's the order I played)

The atmostphere in this game are best! It's soo god dam intense every places i venture on. I start the game with Standard difficulty just to enjoy the game and not stressed over it, but that changed my mind very quickly lol. Even with Standard difficulty, I kept sweating, my heart won't stop pumping ever time I hear that Mr X big footsteps..jesus, I even manage to stucked myself inside Safe room almost an hour, too scared to go out lmfao.

Each playthrough from Leon Scenerio A to Claire Scenerio B too me each around 7 to 8 hours. I do get few frame rates drop randomly but not too often. The design for all characters, Human, zombies and tyrant are very dam good. I love William second transformation holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. It's like fighting a gundam lol.

I have nothing else to say, this game worth the full price Imo. it's just really that good! Playing as Leon again as a Rookie cop was the best. We got to see Leon experience first time horror with his first duty as a RPD Cop. You can see how Leon react in this game, feeling scared/afraid most of the time and not a rambo character.

I'am not even done with this game, 11 hours and I still need to Play Claire Scenerio A and Leon Scenerio B, PLUS 4th survival Mode...Oh Hunk....it's good to hear your voice again...and jesus ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING christ that mode is hard as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Facing 2 Mr X, chasing behind your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, just great. One is not enough.

There are still 2 more modes that I have not unlock, Tofu and the free DLC coming out in the future updates.

This game is practically perfect. Everything just feels absolutely, positively, mother‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing, perfect!

The games detailed gore and zombie destruction definitely scratches the itch I have for wanting to run my hands under someones skin and remove it with the tips of my fingers. Carving away at someones head with a bullet or knife has never felt so satisfying since I played Soldier of Fortune 2.


Likes:
Gore
Gunplay
Replayability
Zombies!

Dislikes:
Easy puzzles


Shooting a zombie will cut away at the area of the model you shot, exposing bones and muscles making for a very satisfying peel of the skin. Limbs can also be cut off in all sorts of different areas (hands, feet, knees, thighs etc.), you can even cut a zombie in half with a well placed shot from Leons shotgun straight to their belly. I love watching them slowly lurch over as you hear their upper body tear away from the lower half, eventually hitting the ground while offal splatters all over the place. You can then observe the creature as it crawls around, dragging its entrails behind itself searching for something to eat. This game could not get any better with been able to toy around with the dead to your deepest desires.

Tons of replayability just like the other RE games where you can keep unlocking fun items to mess around with by completing the game under certain conditions or by completing one of the many records you can choose to complete. It is also a very quick start. No slow boring waiting around intro before you get to the actual game.

The game also has weekly challenges to give you something interesting to do. These are not your typical challenges you see in other games either. They are rather harder than some of the hardest records in the game, making them a very beautiful challenge to accomplish.",Recommended," February 3, 2019"

I spent 6 hours on it and I've only completed Leon's campaign.

Is it worth $60? Debatable.

But there's other scenarios to finish besides Leon's scenario.

I could write an entire essay on ""Why I Think Resident Evil 2's Remake Is A Good Game"" but I'd rather just say that it's a survival horror game with zombies, and it's really tense for most of the game.

The only downside is that all the zombies seem to be too beefy and can tank a ton of damage before actually dying.

For the story, I'll not talk much because something is not make any sense. However, for the atmosphere and system I gotta give it S+. Zombies are hard to kill. The bag is limited. All of this make me feels so tense which is good for a horror game. You can't just shoots everything that move. Every steps must be planned carefully. Moreover, it will becomes more intense lately in the game. Just play and you will know soon that you will be f**ked up.

I have a great childhood memories of staying late at night watching my dad playing the 1998 one. I remember I happily help him solved puzzles together (although I bet I wasn't any bit of help). I remember how much terror it gave me when the big bald guy showed up on surveillance monitor and the frightening music started to play. I remember I eventually fell to my sleep almost every night of watching him playing passionately. I didn't play it by myself back then cause as a 3-year-old kid I was just too scared. Twenty years has passed, and the day this game was announced, I knew I wouldn't be able to skip it.

I was right. I finally completed a piece of my childhood. I immediately jumped into hardcore and loved every great moment I had. I died or load up saves countless times just to find the best strategy to pass through, remembering how my dad always refused my yelling to shoot all zombies he encountered. The old eerie feeling whenever you enter new room. The cautious feeling when you find motionless zombies on the floor. The exploration feeling you got when you search for clues whether for solving puzzle or unlocking locked box to get additional items. The requirement of memorizing the map and managing your inventory slots. The tedious yet rewarding effort of backtracking through the map. The need to assess the situation and predict what will come next for deciding whether to save the game now so I wouldn't waste much time when I die, or save the precious ink ribbon (you need those to save the game in hardcore) instead for later use. And last, my old hate of lickers which now I hate even more. It's basically nightmare if they lurk in the room while you're being chased by Mr. X.

There are a lot more stuff that I failed to mention but overall they totally nailed them with this game. Thank you Capcom. Looking forward when you decide to remake 3, my first Resident Evil game!",Recommended," February 4, 2019"

I'm giving this a thumb down not because it is a bad game, but because it disappoints, doesn't live up to its own setup or hype, and the gameplay lacks the imagination the graphics and environment instill.

The great part is they nailed the locations and feeling of the settings. That was the best part, and almost worth it, but not quite.

But it really isn't that scary, and the actual play doesn't match the move cut scenes. Repeatedly, they will have an incredibly exiting movie scene. An example is when the helicopter crashed into the station, and a movies shows you meeting with the other character (the one you chose not to play) at a gate and fence, and hordes of zombies about to break the fence and attack. Then when it returns to gameplay, all the zeds are gone but three. Same with an exciting gas tanker exploding into a firebomb in the movie, then return to gameplay where all you do is dodge a few zombies in between smoldering cars until you reach the police station. Or at the gas station...or....again and again. It was like being shown a race car, then told the puny go-cart you are given is the same thing.

There is also issue of Mr. X. Some love, some hate, but I can tell you he doesn't add anything other than keep you moving. He has so much potential, again set up in clips, that don't play out in the game. When he first appears in a movie clip, he punches through an exterior prison wall and grabs a man, sight unseen, and crushes his head. He then appears lifting an entire helicopter and moving it aside. But in gameplay, he can't break walls or know where you are hiding unseen, instead prefers to gently push through doors, and isn't good at spotting you. For some reason, he can't get into saferooms, even though a saferoom is just a room with a door, thus making the game mechanics obvious. Mr X feels like a ripoff of ""alien"" in alien:isolation, where he paces the area you are while you avoid him. Except the developers don't do anything creative like in alien where you can hide in lockers, under desks, in vents, or distract the alien with noises. RE2, you can't duck or hide, or trick Mr. X, you just run far enough away he loses you or duck in a safe room. It would be so much scarier if you hid from Mr. X and was afraid he would find you, than slowly jog away until clear.

This last difference from Alien:isolation to RE2 is the key where this game fails. Aliens creates a constant tension because you decide where to hide, when to move, and how to distract, making your choices the reasons for success or failure. RE2 doesn't require much imagination or tactics: avoid Mr. X, kill zeds when necessary, have enough ammo for bosses. You are never submerged in a horde of zombies like the clip movies keep setting up. You can't jump, duck, or hide like a good horror/suspense game would have. Playing the game on harder settings only makes the zeds more bullet sponges, that's it. So other than collecting items, solving puzzles with solutions they give you (literally), slow jogging, and hitting zeds/bosses in their sweet spots, there isn't much gameplay.

They had a chance to set up something special with the duel characters, which had me excited to play again. When you play once, you are a character, but the other character is in the game in other places. When you are inside the gas station, they are outside, when you are in the police station, they are outside. So I was hoping that when I switched characters, they were going to do something cool and original like have me play the other story side. I'd get to show up at the gas station and save the character, or this time I am trapped outside the police station trying to stay alive until the other character gets out. But no. When you switch characters, you play the same story and the other character is on the outside. In the year 2019 for a $60 game, I thought they would be creative enough to give me two sides to the story, but no.

Ultimately, this is a lamer version of Alien:isolation. The zombies in this are robots in AI, Mr. X in this is the Alien in AI. It even has the same weapon issue where a knife can kill a zombie as easy as multiple headshots, like the wrench could kill a robot as easy as multiple headshots. Except AI had more creative gameplay and tactical options, where here you just run or hide in saferooms. This game tries to cover what it lacks in amazing graphics and exciting movie cut scenes, and it works for a while, until you start wishing you were playing the game in the clips and not the one you are walking around in.

It's like a big budget hollywood movie. Beautiful to look at, keeps moving, but doesn't engage or challenge on a deeper level. If this game had a fair balance of poor reviews, I might give it a thumbs up, but as overhyped as it is, it deserves a thumbs down for consumers to know it isn't amazing. It's just a good game with great graphics and mediocre gameplay. If you want to try this game, wait until it goes on sale.",Not Recommended," March 30, 2019"

Not really a bad gaame, but not one I can really reccomend. My first Playthrough took roughly 4 and a half hours. I did a lot of back tracking, grabbed a bunch of optional stuff, and spent a good amount of time on a few puzzles. I never played the original either, so that didn't factor into the short play time either. Without any kind of nostaglia goggles on, I feel like the game is good, but has some problems. The first being the affromentioned game length. I get there is another playthrough I Can do, and I've already started it, but it's much of the same content, areas, and environmnets, with a few remixed things, it's not an ENTIRELY new game. Next is the enemies just feel, annoying. It's SO RNG dependant on when they go down, sometimes you'll get lucky and their head will blow off in one shot, sometimes, not so much. I never felt like the game was challanging, or scary, I was more just annoyed, and thought the enemies just were getting in the way, chosing to run past them, not because I wanted to ""conserve ammo"" but just because, why bother killing them?

The writing is hit and miss, some of it is insanely awkward, and the chemistry between characters can feel pretty weird at times. Sound and Graphics are both excelent, and some of the best I've ever seen in a game.

I understand it's a remake, but honestly it FEELS like a remake, it feels like an old game remade. It feels short, and some of the ideas in the game feel out of date. If you're cool with this, or love the original, then buy it by all means, but for me personally. I want a lot more out of a $60 game then a four and a half hour story I can replay for another few hours of going through the same areas again.

REmake 2 captures the essence of the twenty plus year old classic Playstation release and re-imagines it with modern gameplay and visuals. It strikes an almost perfect balance between feeling fresh and familiar, the richly rendered environments are familiar but the incredible amount of detail and third person over the shoulder perspective allows you to enjoy them in a whole new way. The critical path is largely the same from the original games but those who could run through the original game in their sleep will find enough changes and surprises to keep them on their toes. This game isn't quite perfect however, combat can be a little frustrating since zombies can be bullet sponges. Headshots do have a chance to deliver one hit kills but it's so inconsistent that it becomes difficult to determine whether to engage or not as, in typical classic RE fashion, resources are limited. The calculus around engagement is really frustrating when you don't know if a zombie will take seven bullets to down or three. Smart and persistent players will overcome this however. Ultimately fans of classic RE have a lot to be excited about since Capcom have delivered a product that pays perfect homage to one of the Playstation's landmark titles and what is arguably the greatest survival horror game of all time.",Recommended," June 29, 2019"

If you've never played Resident Evil 2 before, play it. If your answer is ""I'm not going to play it"", then you can pretty safely play this remake instead.

If you've never played any Resident Evil game, and don't want to go back to 90's classics, you should probably start with the remake of Resident Evil (1), but you can also start with this game.

If you've loved the Resident Evil franchise like me and RE2 has always been one of your favorites in the series, YOU CAN NOT miss this game.

This remake captures everything good about RE2, other than perhaps the unforgettable soundtrack and the camera perspective. This game, in my opinion, is the best remake of all time, now trumping the previous title-holder Resident Evil.

I played through this 4 times (you'd know why if you've played a RE game) on PC, 4 times on PS4 and 4 times on XBOX. I wish this would come out on a new platform so I could play through it 4 times more.",Recommended," September 25, 2019"

As a longtime fan of the resident evil series who has found himself more and more disillusioned by the more recent entries, with some exceptions. I have to say this remake has far far exceeded my expectations. Its not only the best remake I've ever played (a title previously held by the Resident Evil 1 remake) its also the best resident evil game I've ever played. Resident evil 2 was one of my all time favourite games. This game captures the feel of the original perfectly, it is at once completely faithful and entirely improved. From the story - to the gameplay. Everything is bolder and better. The puzzles in particular are brilliantly done so much so I was eagerly awaiting the next puzzle just moments after solving the previous.

The way theyve handled the enemies is also spectacular. All the best ones are here and improved.
I havent been as scared by zombies since... well ever to be honest.
The lickers are even scarier and the placement of them is unexpected and brilliant
The cereberus dogs are still bastards and I hate them but they work so well.
Birkin is grotesque, impossibly tough and still a brilliant boss battle

But the star of the show in my opinion is the (previously) woefully underused tyrant prototype T-00. Also known as Mr. X or my personal favourite name for him which Leon aptly calls him in the original japanes script. ""The Coated Bastard""
and oh he is one coated ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing bastard. He'll stalk you relentlessly and disturbingly calmly. Causing you no small amount of anxiety. Especially when you hear his thunderous footsteps getting closer and closer. I will say though, for those of you that are worried he'll dog you the entire game never giving any respite. He does in fact appear at certain times and stops hunting you after some events but this does nothing to relieve the terror you'll feel when he is near.

In summary this title should please even the most die hard fans of the classics as well as fans of the more recent action titles. It has it all.

The nightmare has only just begun. As you once again step into the world of survival horror...

More reviews on our Curator Page

The original Resident Evil 2 was released in late 1998, and was instantly considered the best horror game ever created. The concept of what‚Äôs ‚Äúbest‚Äù is relevant, but one truth remains, as the old classic is always among the favorite by fans. That title, however, will never change, because changing nostalgia is impossible and with time, we adorn it, with even more elements of grandiosity. It‚Äôs a human thing to do, to celebrate our memories with further sentiments of pleasure. Another thing humans do, it‚Äôs to improve themselves, at each generation, and so, we‚Äôre welcomed with Resident Evil 2 Remake.

Just one month has passed since the dreadful events at Spencer Mansion, and the isolated incident seems to be behind everyone‚Äôs mind now, but another terror arises, slowly, under the innocent minds of Racoon City‚Äôs population.

Claire Redfield travels to Racoon City, on her special Harley Davidson and her lucky jacket made in heaven, hoping to find her dear brother, Chris Redfield.
Leon Kennedy just graduated from the police academy, and Raccoon City was his first place of choice, considering the strange deaths occurring just one month ago. While driving to his destination, he finds a corpse on the road. Not any corpse though, this one was quite different‚Ä¶

Their paths will come together, as they have to fight for survival, each in its own way, and at the same time, uncover the deepest secrets underneath Racoon City.

is slowly trying to replace some original facts that have previously been settled, such as the events leading Leon to Raccoon City, where originally he had woken up later from being drunk, now he was apparently just quietly sitting at home waiting to get on duty. Probably to appease a more softcore audience, these changes weren‚Äôt the only ones. Some of those changes consist in the alternative routes both protagonists take, but that was to be expected with a remake. Their emotional side, however, shines with the modern technology.

The game direction choice is on the spot, and the narrative very pleasant, restraining the action to the necessary basis, and not on the ridiculous cheesy stunt-level of trying to surpass Holywood. Cutscenes are worth of a movie with real actors behind each movement, and atmospherically perfect with amazing angles that pushes each scene into waves of vibrant passionate moments.

Visually, stays far away as possible from cheap horror components that have been haunting games for a while now. Low-cost jump scares, complete darkness and the low-tier environments, we‚Äôve all seen in those claimed horror experiences are nothing compared to what we can experience at Raccoon City. Instead, players feel the emptiness progressively interrupted by deadly agents, either the Mr.X or a cleverly placed zombie just slowly walking towards you.

This remake may very well have, some of the most beautiful graphics I‚Äôve seen. Detailed not only at the large scale, but also in small everyday objects. Reflexes on the floors are outstanding, the rain effect on the concrete shines naturally, the contrast of the light against the rain over the broken windows is something stunning to look at. Not even mentioning the condensation effect present in the Greenhouse glass windows! The graphical quality achieved is without a doubt a step above the Triple-A experience we‚Äôve got used to, even with other major titles on the market.

Cloths for both Claire and Leon look very realistic, and with time, they become dirty, wet or just increasingly weary. The same treatment was used for zombies, has each zombie is visually detailed, with extreme facial expressions of rage, and pure terror. Blood is now very real, almost distinguished, from fresh to coagulated, when splattered on walls or floors. Gore went back to its fundamental horror-themed principle, of a primordial frightening human complex, in a marvelous way. Zombies are gruesome, but so it‚Äôs the ruin of the flesh in its decomposing way, and expressed perfectly well the idea of simple zombies being scary, other than just rambling living dead! These are, however, very repetitive, as there‚Äôs a few of them that change in cloths but their faces and sizes remain. Other creatures such as Lickers were remade to the core, based on the originals, and are looking better than ever.

Resident Evil came along away, from fixed camera angles, to pretty much redefining third person shooters. This remake though, shows us some of the most flawless third person action we came across, with some cons and pros. Some of the changes might not please every fan, due to the game‚Äôs natural adaptive difficulty. This method defines pretty much every action, including the damage inflicted on zombies. Although it‚Äôs still a surviving horror, there are damage-critics and damage attributes, that sometimes depend 100% on the game, and not on the player skill, making it a dice roll of chances when trying to accomplish that amazing headshot that splatters a zombie head in two. The difficulty, as well as the critical attributes will define the result. It‚Äôs clearly a long way since the original, and we can‚Äôt stomp laying zombies either.

This makes an incredible ambiguous game, leaving players debating external possibilities, such as knife damage being affected by the frame rate, or bullets fired under a perfectly fixed crosshair inflicting more damage than firing a gun without proper forming the full reticle first. Automatically, headshots are no longer certain to kill a zombie, unless it‚Äôs a shotgun, but regardless, it‚Äôs a mechanic that might not please everyone, even though I personally understand the necessity of having a constant intensity within the game.

This remake is the perfect combination of a third person shooter, with a fluidity of action I‚Äôve personally never seen in before. Hitboxes are extremely well polished, with accurate precisions, especially for playable characters. Field of View can extend the field vision for a wider perspective, without compromising the experience, or spawning bugs. PC version delivers a unique and customized experience, which is fantastic, and almost makes all the console ports we‚Äôve been getting over the years forgettable.

If there‚Äôs one thing PC Gamers appreciate is the quality and efforts put into technical settings, and Capcom surely surprised us in the best possible way. With a very Ubisoft-look, the panel for graphical and visual details look fantastic, providing an automatic and in-time perspective over the changes each setting does while being On or Off. Textures, Volumetric Lightning, Anti-Aliasing, all the crucial options are extremely accessible while in the menu, as well as other visual effects such as Chromatic Aberration, that thankfully can just be toggled Off.

Soundtrack unfortunately is not as memorable as the original, but there is still a good effort into sound effects, who mostly serve to follow the game‚Äôs intensity, with generic orchestrated events. There is, however, a DLC to expand the experience with the original soundtrack, which should have been included from the very start! The whole sensation of terror, is back, with the genuine feeling that plagues your mind with the unknown at the end of a hallway. The game uses most of the player‚Äôs senses, including hearing sounds, to help spot where the danger truly lies in. Soundworks regarding in-game effects is outstanding!

rolls back the irreplaceable feeling of atmospheric horror, desolation and still resembling extremely well with the original. Alongside the classics, this remake is without a doubt one of the best in the series, and highly recommended for both classic and new fans alike.",Recommended," February 13, 2019"

This game is fantastic, a great re-imagining of a classic. If this game came out a month earlier it would have been my best game for 2019. I want to begin this by saying I have trouble completing single player game. I usually play them, get a bit of the way through and ultimately become bored and go back to a multiplayer option. Not with this game, it is the first single player game in a long time I have completed, but beyond that I've completed it twice. I might even play through a third or fourth time to be honest.

At first, I thought the price was a bit up there for what I had considered to be a remake, but the moment I started my first game as Leon it sucked me in. The effort and heart that went into this game astounds me, the amount of detail in every visual. Every haunting sound of this game's world and stellar sound track immersed me to no end. I simply could not put it down, I meticulously picked apart this game. Exploring every facet I could before doing it again.

If you didn't know already, there are two characters to play as; excluding other game modes. You play as either Leon or Claire. My first start was with Leon, which was fantastic. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't go too deep into the story. But it is engaging enough to keep you going, while there are some moments of weak writing there are moments that blew me away. There was more character develop in Leon's interactions with Marvin in a three minute cut scene, than I have seen in entire other games.

But not just that, when you beat the game for the first time you unlock the ability to play through with a specific 'Second Run'. The story is changed, the game takes a different turn almost and it is just enough to feel familiar but not like I am replaying the first play through. I cannot stand repeating the same sections in a game, this causes me to become quickly frustrated. But RE2 changes it up enough for it to feel fresh in the second play through making it genuinely different. I cannot praise this game enough.

I have never drooled over a game like this before, but I am happy to take my time to write this review. As a consumer in a market that is currently incredibly anti-consumer. Seeking for any way to hoover up the last remaining dollars in your wallet, you owe it to yourself to give yourself this experience. This is one of the few titles that set out to fulfill it's goal of creating a fantastic 'Survival Horror' game and stepped past it's goal in leaps and bounds. There is no money gouging in this game, just good old fashioned fun.",Recommended," February 7, 2019"

Great game. Just the balancing is not great in my opinion. Enemies are pure bullet sponges. Also what sucked is that almost every time you shoot down a zombie, he will rise again once or twice and you can ""kill"" him again. After about half of the game ""tyrant"" apears, an invicible enemey. Does this sound like fun? No? That's because it's not.
Also the lickers are way too strong. They deal massive damage, are super fast and have a lot of health.
The 3 difficulties aren't great: assist mode is just too easy, then standard was for my first playthrough pretty hard and veteran is even harder. But I guess that's how difficulties work. Just nitpicking from me. Still I think there should be a difficulty between the lower two.
And if you now say to yourself: ""This guy is crying about the difficulty because he is so bad in the game."" To those I can say: I beat the game countless times and got 100% achievements.

Also the story is a bit weak in my opinion.


But besides that the game is really great: graphics, sound design, level design, atmosphere, gameplay, both puzzles and fights (although the enemies take too much bullets to kill). I wouldn't consider this too much as an horror game, rather a third person survival shooter. I understand why the game got 96% positive reviews on steam. It's just hard to not like the game. But if I had to give an acutal rating, it would be 90/100. The flaws in the difficulty and story are the reasons why I can't give more.",Recommended," February 2, 2019"

I don't have a nostalgic feeling for the original RE2 as I have with RE1, because I only played it a lot later in my life, so RE2 doesn't resonate with me the same way it does to most people. Saying that I do like the original RE2 and this remake too, it really is something special. I wont lie, I prefere the pre-rendered backgrounds of RE1 Remake, but RE2 Remake has fantastic visuals! The gameplay still has that strategic planning side to it of the classic games and everything works pretty nicely together. It also has a lot of replayability with 2 different campaigns and two different routes each.",Recommended, January 21

The 1998 Resident Evil 2 no doubt is master piece and no other game can out match it. With the release of new Resident Evil 2 Remake it has been a global success and the game itself is very satisfying. Capcom knows how to please their fans the one that brought up with the series. In past few games RE did left its charm as Survival horror and become more of an action zombie killing game. Though RE is all about surviving even with 10 bullets in your hands. Good to see it has remake and kept its original taste. Now time for RESIDENT EVIL 3: NEMESIS REMAKE. For those of you who aren't familiar with the series I will still advice you @all to play the original game the RE2 and RE3 from 1998 & 1999. Yes its old with robotic type graphics but the story and game play is marvelous. Especially if you play RE3: Nemesis, I bet you will all have your nightmares when the big ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• tyrant stalking you in every room and corner of city. I am a huge RE fan and I have played all of the RE games except for the outbreak. I did play outbreak but never finish the game beside that I play all games back from 1998. Yes it's true I am old but hey its good to play your favorite childhood game in today's technology.


Pros
- Great Camera Angle over the shoulder like RE4
- Good Graphics and Animation nicely done
- Thanks to RE Engine ,the game has lot of Graphics option to choose which make it easy to run in most of the system.
- Original OST & Costumes with DLC pack
- Lot of Jump Scares
- Zombies surprise attack
- Lot of new modes
- Addictive game style
- X gon' give it to ya
- The great Tofu mode is back
- It has the Original horror survival environment.
- Original Character design is back


Cons
- Due to dark scary game the light effects can be very dull and dark at certain stages of level and make it unable to see
- Zombie take lot of bullets to die in Standard Mode and Hardcore Mode
- Lack of interaction of Leon and Claire in the game as compare to original
- Story A has no effect on Story B which was not the case in original
- The sounds of gunshots are very similar to one another making it no difference from other guns.
- Seems bit short game play, I feel the original RE was longer than this one.


Anyway at end, I will highly recommend this game. Even if you are not familiar with Resident Evil franchise this game is surely worth playing. You will not regret it.",Recommended," February 25, 2019"

The modern return to Raccoon City is looking refined as ever as a staple to how developers should handle remakes.
Perfect entry point to new comers of the series and to those who have played the original through rose tinted glasses way back in the late 90s.

I don't usually place reviews on games being only minutes into playing it but I am extremely impressed with the overall technical performance on display here. The game is beautifully optimised while still managing to make the environment look crisp as ever on a less than HD screen. The fact that a game from early 2019 manages to run on my potato GTX 940mx laptop with stable 40 fps on medium settings is just bloody impressive.

Controls are smooth as margarine
Graphics make real life look dull and drab

Disclaimer: Bought this game in February and I've been meaning to review this game for a long time, just got around to it now.

TL;DR This game is an easy 9/10. It scared the crap out of me. Every enemy is a threat that you cannot ignore. The atmosphere, the graphics, the gameplay, it is near perfection. Not only is the a faithful remake of the fantastic original, it will easily standalone as a classic. It is 100% worth the full $60 price tag and I don't regret a single penny spent. Should you see it on sale at any point, buy it because it is a freaking steal.

In-depth review:

The original Resident Evil 2 is one of my all time favorite games from one of my all time favorite franchises. However, like most long time fans, I began to despise the series with every game *after* the legendary RE4. It wasn't until Resident Evil Revelations 2 that the series showed potential again, then with Resident Evil 7, hope. When Resident Evil 2 remake was announced, and even more so, the amazing trailer, the hype... the hype was unreal for EVERYONE. I'm happy to say, this game surpassed my expectations. I tried going to in this game with as little bias and as much skepticism as possible. Regardless, the game blew my mind.

Gameplay and Atmosphere:

I'm combing these two, because when it comes to horror games, atmosphere should have an affect on the gameplay. It is superb on both ends. The controls are fluid and more similar to a typical third person shooter as opposed to the classic tank controls (that I know and love). You are very limited in what you can do, as your characters aren't the super heroes that they become in later games. You can walk/run, shoot annnd that's about it. That's how it should be, you dodge by running away and keeping your distance. Enemies are bullet sponges, your handgun is ALMOST useless as a weapon to kill with as enemies can take 8-20 HEADSHOTS to put down (luckily you can disable zombies by shooting their legs and/or arms off, it's up to you to decide if it's worth it). Ammo is incredibly limited so you have to save it for emergencies, running away is almost always a better option, assuming you are able to. Until you get more powerful weapons, fighting is not recommended (as it should be). The atmosphere in this game is on par with the legendary Resident Evil 1 remake. It's dark, it's eerie, it's forboding and more importantly it keeps you on edge and makes you hope that noise you heard around the corner wasn't something that wants to kill you. This game has made me NEED to take breaks because the stress of being low on ammo and knowing what I have to deal with outside the safe room was too much for me.

The Difficulty:

This game has 3 difficulties; Assisted, Standard, Hardcore.
I'm in the minority here. I fully recommend on your FIRST play through... play this game on Hardcore difficulty. It's what I did.
Ammo is even more scarce, enemies deal far more damage, and most importantly, limited saves. On Hardcore mode you must use the Ink Ribbon items to save your game at the type writer, and Ink Ribbons are finite. Also, if you die, it's back to the last time you saved, no check points (so for example if you die near the end of the game without saving at all, you'll have to start all over.)
This adds SO MUCH tension, fear and consequence to the gameplay. Hardcore difficulty is tough, but damn if you're patient and careful, it's fair. This was the best gaming experience I've had in a long time.

Graphics:

Not much to say here. Beautiful. The games well optimized. My computer is pretty old, but at medium-high settings with a consistent 60FPS.

Story:

It's decent. Characters are a lot more believable and more fleshed out (Marvin's really cool here). Still, it's nothing special. However, in the flaws section of this review, I will explain why the story does not make sense in some places.

Flaws:

In classic RE2, you can play as Leon and Claire in both the A and B campaigns, each campaign is ALMOST completely different from each other. You can use each character in either campaign. So you can do Leon A then Claire B to get the true ending, or Claire A then Leon B then the true ending. Technically giving your 4 campaigns. Thank fully this returns in REmake 2. However, the difference between the campaigns is noticeably less than the original. The first half of the campaigns is the only real difference between, for example, Claire A and Claire B. After that, it's indistinguishable. Also, each campaign reuses several bosses, and routes (something absent from the original) which is not only repetitive, but also makes 0 sense for the story (some characters die twice). It's not enough to make me dislike the game, but it is the sole thing holding this game back from a 10/10.


Final Thoughts:

This game's a masterpiece and I know it sold well, which means Capcom will likely make a Resident Evil 3 remake (I hope so).
Easy 9/10. Buy this game so that Capcom hears our wallets and knows they did this game right. Capcom's on a roll and I knew that one day, they'd rise from their hole that they dug. Thank goodness they did. I went from completing Leon A on Hardcore in 16 hours to beating all 4 campaigns in under 2 hours each, getting S+ rank for each campaign. That's how invested I was.",Recommended," August 24, 2019"

Was never really interested in the series, but this turned out to be a surprise hit on my list!
A horror game done right, it gets your heart pumping and adrenaline running, yet isn't just a bunch of cheap scares.

Even though the content and storyline originates from the 1998 RE2, this is so polished and refined that it simply plays like a new game of 2019. Having been my first RE, it was indeed new to me either way!

Apart from the beefy content of the main game, with its bonus modes and unlockables, brand new DLC was also released for free. Ghost Survivors is a roguelike-style expansion with 3 new playable characters, and an additional one unlockable after completing the first 3 campaigns. With new scenarios, enemies and weapons, each run is randomized, quick and intense to keep things even fresher.",Recommended," April 9, 2019"

This is Old school gaming at its finest, they usually dont make games like this anymore. This game is almost perfect fusion of modern and old school gaming elements. OTS camera combined with map design which players by the end remembers like his own house layout. Add to that a terminator chasing you all around your house and you remebering every hiding corner and shortcut to avoid him. Getting shivers down your spine you hear his footsteps. Not coming out of your room. Running like a madmen for your life as he is chasing and taking wrong turns and getting overwhelmed, opening your map and making new strategy and chalking out new route to reach your objective. And you have more threats along the way. But you outsmart them all because you learnt the map and remember what awaits where and escape except the terminator, he comes randomly and thinking while on the run raises the stakes. Fire bullets on zombies he listens, walk slowly because lickers will hear you, pounce on you. And also focus the footsteps of the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in terminator. This is insane stuff.

Combined with amazing atmosphere where the flashlight is your friend to explore all those dark rooms, corridors and sewers. Next level gore, sound effects, graphics and tight pacing. The story runs in high gear all the time and you keep on wanting more. Great mix of real life puzzles, exploration, inventory management, just enough ammo, action and boss fgihts.

Absolutely redefines what makes a good remake. Fantastic visuals that gives off a perfect atmosphere. Fantastic audio cues that gives a good sense of direction and space for when something is either in another room or right next to you. Tight controls, but just clunky enough to make you not feel invincible (perfect for a survival horror).

Unfortunately, the game gets very tedious after 2 campaigns. I assume due to budget and time constraints, the Zapping System isn't much and makes Leon A and Leon B basically the same experience except for the beginning. What's worse is that just doing Claire A and Leon B or Leon A and Claire B still creates a very contradictory story line that doesn't make sense if you think about it.

Performance-wise, I couldn't ask for much more. The graphical options like noise filter toggling, chromatic aberration settings, different rendering options, etc etc makes this game run surprisingly well for me very low end laptop.

All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this game if you want a good return to true Survival Horror form",Recommended," February 12, 2019"

Introduction
Before starting this review, i would like to say that i don't have any nostalgic connection to Resident Evil 2 since i never played it when it originally came out.

Resident Evil 2 (2019) is the remake to the original game from 1998. Though calling this game a simple ""Remake"" would be a disservice as RE2 (2019) is pretty much a whole new game, this makes that they're different enough and so you can still play the original. The only things that are from the original is the plot, setting, and characters, everything else is different.

The game is now a third-person shooter (for better or worse, personally i like the change in the perspective), the layout of the police station and the game as a whole is similiar but vastly changed, the story and characters are more fleshed out than in the original, certain events play out differently than in the original and this makes veteran players to stay on their toes, and i could go on and on but it would take too long.

Before you play this game, i highly suggest you to play the Resident Evil 1 Remake, while the gameplay is vastly different from this game, playing it would give you an idea of what a Resident Evil is and what it should be. Plus, it's pretty important to the story for this game and it's definitely one of the best games of all time.



Resident Evil 2 takes place a few months after the first game. After a recent zombie breakout in Racoon City, you need to find out what the hell's going on as you explore the police station and beyond. You can play as one of two characters when you start the game. The first one is Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie cop on his first day of the job. And the other one is Claire Redfield, a college student who is looking for his brother Chris Redfield who is one of the playable characters in the first game. Unlike the first game, each of the characters have a totally different story and subplots. As Leon, you'll encounter Ada Wong. While as Claire, you'll encounter Sherry. As i said it's kinda hard to not spoil this game so you might as well play the game and see for yourself. Overall, it's a well written story with likeable characters though i wish leon's campaign had a bit more too it.


While this game is third-person, it's still Resident Evil through and through. Resident Evil 2 is a Survival-Horror game much like it's predecessors. Basically, Survival-Horror is a sub-genre of horror that focuses and puts emphasis on Inventory Management, Puzzle Solving, having a Vulnerable playable character, a somewhat Slow-Paced Combat, and of course backtracking (it may not be in every survival-horror game but it's a huge part of the Resident Evil Series).


This game probably has some of the best atmosphere ever in a horror game. It's dark, scary, and has some of the best audio design ever.


Having a limited inventory space means you can't pick up everything you see, if your inventory is full and you need to pick up an item, you either need to discard one of your items or backtrack to the last save room so you can store some of your items. This becomes a game in itself as you find out what's best to bring, what to store, and what to discard.


Speaking of backtracking, you will be doing it ALOT and trust me it's not as annoying as everybody says, hell i think it's actually done pretty great (just like the old RE games). You need to memorize what room you need to get to and what key you need, if you don't memorize things so well, don't be worried as RE2 probably has the best and most friendly Map Interface in the whole series, rooms you haven't fully explored will be colored red, items you haven't picked up will have a logo, and puzzles you haven't solved will have an exclamation mark.


Movement is very similiar to RE7 only in a Third-Person Perspective, it's kinda slow compared to other games but you still move faster than most of the enemies. Slow doesn't mean it's bad though, more like the opposite, if it was faster it would ruin the game's overall tone and atmosphere so yea i really like it. The game controls really well with mouse and keyboard and you can keybind pretty much every key, my only complaint is that you cant use your mouse in alot of the puzzles though it's probably more of a nitpick since i got used to it pretty quick.


Just like the movement, combat is slow-paced but it's till fun because it has some split second choices and strategy. For example, you need to get to another room but there are a couple of zombies blocking the way, you can kill them and you'll lose some of your ammo but if you backtrack to that room again you wont have to deal with them again, Or you can lead them out of your way and escape but once you go back to that room you will encounter them again. There are alot more examples than this but in a nutshell, that's pretty much it.

My only complaint with the combat is that killing zombies have some RNG and boy oh boy it's really annoying. Basically because of the game's adaptive difficulty, zombies can take up to 10-20 shots to the head if you rarely die, but at the same time, some of them only take up to 2-5 shots to the head, hopefully they fix this in the future as it might turn new players away. While yes the old games have some really long time to kill as well, it never felt this annoying.


Of couse i can't talk about the game without talking about the enemies and one particular big dude that you'll encounter while playing. First, you have your regular zombies which are surprisingly scary. They might not be that intimidating if you encounter only one of them, but they sure can be a hassle if there's alot of them, they can take alot of damage but they move incredibly slow so my suggestion is to avoid them almost all the time if you can so you don't waste your ammo. Second, one of the most iconic enemies ever introduced in the series, The Lickers. They're basically mutated and more powerful zombies and way scarier, encountering one of them is scary enough and you'll be fu*ked if you meet more than one. There are a few more enemy types but i wont spoil them.

I would like to talk about one more though and that is..... Mister Motherfu*kin X. Some people said that he ruins the game but i beg to differ. He's probably my favorite thing about this game as he makes you to keep your guard up. I won't spoil where or when you encounter him, so just prepare to be fu*ked.


Audio design is really great, zombies and lickers sound scary and Mr. X's footsteps sounds terrifying as fu*k. Music on the other hand is a bit hit or miss, this is my personal opinion so yours might be different but IMO the soundtrack is just too subtle. I think it's because they want the game to be more scary with it's fantastic audio design but with less and more subtle music. But after recently completing the RE1 remake, the game can still prove itself to be really scary with more noticable music. Even the save room theme isn't that memorable in this game because i can barely hear it. The best music is probably the Mr. X theme which can be really intimidating when you hear it. This is why i think it's kinda bullsh*t that you have to pay for the original soundtrack because i really prefer it over the new one and like i said before, i don't even have any nostalgic connection with this game.


Overall this game is certainly one of the best games to come out this year but there are certainly a few problems that hold it back from being a true masterpiece. I'm glad that capcom is finally bringing Classic Survival-Horror back to the mainstream market and i'm really excited for the future of this series.",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

Oh no, zombies.

Resident Evil 2 is a remake of Resident Evil 2. You play as Leon Scott Kennedy, a very special boy who still tries to arrest people as the city around him is turning into dust.
Or you play as Claire Redfield, the sister of boulder punching giga hunk Chris Redfield. She's looking for her brother because its 1998 and cell phones haven't been invented by John Henry Cellphone yet.
Both stories follow Leon and Claire as they attempt to escape Raccoon City while also uncovering the secrets that Umbrella has hidden.
Like larger blister monsters. Or unstoppable super weapons that think its okay to wear a fedora.

Resident Evil 2 retells the story of Resident Evil 2 while stepping away from some story beats of Resident Evil 2. Leon and Clair don't even really look like how they looked in Resident Evil 2, since technology has come a long way since 1280 AD and now we have things like motion capture and actors.

With the liberties Resident Evil 2 takes with Resident Evil 2's story, I started looking at it like a movie based on the events instead of a complete retelling of Resident Evil 2.

Okay, I'll stop now.

Biohazard 2 is one of those games that I loaded up, started my first playthrough, and then didn't close it until I finished my first playthrough. Something about the gameflow just kept me glued to the game from start to finish. It wasn't the story, since I'm old and already know how it ends. But it has more to do that the game is just kind of made for me.

You see from over your character's shoulder, and not from the view of a bug in the corner of the room like the original RE2. I actually liked tank controls from the original, but I also like pulling hair out of my nose, so take that as you will.

Exploring a destroyed police department made by the greatest madman known to humanity, while poking your flashlight over dark corners and committing police brutality on the undead is just kind of tickled me in the naughty bits. There's a flow to the gameplay that I can get behind, where you just kind of know where to go. I didn't even notice the location markers on my map until I was almost done my first play through.

Enemies this time around are much tougher than they were in previous games, with the zambos being able to sometimes take entire magazines to the noggin with only having stern words to say to you later.
The stern words are biting.

You come across other enemies in the game, lickers make a return, as well as Conrad: The Hungry Alligator. There are also some enemies missing, like the giant spider. I was told that people were having panic attacks and running out of the room during play testing. I don't know how true that is, but I'm going to believe it.
Because its funny.

Urban Terror 2 also brings back T-00, an enemy that only shows up in some runs of the original game. Only instead of showing up as a boss encounter of sorts, now he follows you around and gives me the same mental experience as being chased by teenagers or my drunken father.

He's not as annoying as I thought he would be, since you can avoid him completely if you know what you're doing.

What else do I like?

I like how the guns feel, it's nice to shoot things in this game. Please don't tell my parole officer I said that.

Everything has a nice, meaty crunch to it when you shoot them, zombie limbs and brain domes fall apart under gun fire, and sometimes their heads just kind of rupture after one hit. It feels nice to shoot things. Which says more about me than it does about the game.

You should play Resident Evil: The Second. I'm glad I got to play it before the year is out, since I had my eyes on it since its release and I never actually got around to buying the game.
You get a few run throughs of the game, with two stories per character. You also get some extra content with the game, letting you play as two other characters as well as the return of everyone's main man: HUNK.
I love him.

Special thanks again to Evan for sending me this game, please stop speaking Latin and dabbling in the occult.

By far the best Resident evil Game after Resident Evil 4, and best remake. This game brings that survival horror back with our fav characters. Graphics r soo good that even if u play on low settings it will look awesome. great thing is they removed QTE from game. but only downside for me is A n B r kinda same. Claire n Leon both in police station but never come across eachother or the puzzles leon solved will be there to solve again in Claire's. And yea Clair's LIPS.... bad job....",Recommended," February 9, 2019"

This game has accomplished what the original did and then expanded upon it with current generation gaming expectations. I've played it for almost an hour so far and will be playing it way more. Now they just need to make RE3 and Dino Crisis remake, that would make my finest memories as a kid playing Capcom games complete as an adult.

Secret character Tofu is back at it again!
1. Complete storyline for Leon.
2. Unlock second run mode and complete storyline for Clair.
3. Unlock true ending and new storyline 4th Survivor, complete that storyline as Hunk.
4. Unlock Tofu survivor, coolest easter egg of original Resident Evil 2.
Now you can play as a Tofu!

Overall, incredible amount of effort put into details, animations, cutscenes - literally everything. Mechanics feels right, sound is sharp and visually looks absolutely stunning. No doubt it's going to be a main pretendent for .

RE2 is the best horror survival game. The game looks new and feels great, but bear in mind that the encounters with characters happened in different scenarios. Mr. X scares me every time I hear His foot steps going around me. The voice acting is great andÔªø I love the new tracks as much as the old one. I wish the spiders were in the game but they replaced them with G-Virus at sewers. I wished also the co-op moment was there between Ada and Leon. For the sake of Mr Raccoon achievement I think it is easy to find them without making you suffer like other games, for example God of War and Eyes of Odin. It is worth mentioning that the best weapon is a knife and legs are the weakest spot in zombies. looking forward for the RE 3 remake and the weird smile.

This game it really fantastic and well worth the wait. It's different from the original in some ways, but it certainly pays homage and expands upon the 21 year old original.

It looks gorgeous and the performance is well optimised. It's certainly not for the faint of heart as it is quite a scary romp.

Near flawless remake of a timeless classic. Worth every penny I paid, and I definitely sunk a lot of hours into it already at the time of this review.

If there's one thing I can highlight out of my survival horror experience, it's got to be the enemy encounters. Capcom more than delivers from the start with the zombies alone, as they are finally made scary again with how resilient they are to damage. I don't even need to mention Mr. X, since all the memes surrounding him speak for themselves; he's truly a menace. I am sad however, that a few iconic enemies were cut from the game. These being the spiders in the sewers, the crows in the 2nd floor, and the giant moth in the lab. Fortunately for me, they left in the disgusting roaches! Now I'll never forget which storage compartment not to open in the morgue.

Anyway...

For this to be a fair review, I do have my own personal gripes about the game.
The B scenarios for instance, were a bit disappointing. Other than your starting location, an additional gun unique to the character, and some changes in item placement, there was nothing different about how everything played out. It honestly feels more like it was tacked on at a later stage in development, while the focus was mainly on the 1st run of each character's story. The only reason to even play the 2nd run is to see how it really ends.

All in all, I very much enjoyed the game, and know that Capcom will see their success here as a reason to give Resident Evil 3: Nemesis the remake it deserves!",Recommended," February 16, 2019"

I've been playing Resident Evil since its first released on PlayStation. There I've played and finished Resident Evil 1, 2 and 3, I can remember unlocking every possible ending (yes even the bad ones) / secrets.
Come Resident Evil 4, 5 and 6. Never finish 4 and 6, and finished 5 because of one day got stuck on my nephew's and we finished it together. While I do enjoy the game, I'm just not very into it.

Ever since July 2018 when I first watched the reveal trailer on youtube it has been on my wishlist.
Resident Evil 2 Remake got everything right, the tension, the scarcity of ammo and health, the Zombies durability, the way Lickers move and react, and even the unpredictable Mr. X. It's perfect and I just love it all.
There's even secrets and unlockables, and it's not on DLC or some sh*t, its really unlocking things such as new infinite weapons or costumes and even new game modes if you finished the game a certain way.

Few nitpick of mine is that the original soundtrack is locked under DLC, also some section *WARNING SPOILER* also *Spoiler ends*

But like I said, it's just my nitpick, other than that, it's perfect. I recommend this awesome game and I thank you Capcom to make this happen.

""Hope I don't have to write a report on this!""

O que √© Resident Evil 2 Remake?

Resident Evil 2 √© um jogo de sobreviv√™ncia feito pela Capcom onde voc√™ controla Leon ou Claire e tenta escapar de Raccoon City que est√° infestada de mortos vivos. Ali√°s, √© um remake do jogo original lan√ßado em 1998.

Gameplay:

Em Resident Evil 2 Remake voc√™ escolhe o seu personagem e devido a alguns acontecimentos voc√™ acaba parando na delegacia de pol√≠cia de uma pequena cidade, voc√™ ent√£o precisa se virar para descobrir o que est√° acontecendo, com poucas balas, uma arma muito b√°sica e uma mochilinha pequena voc√™ come√ßa a sua jornada.

Independente de quem escolher voc√™ pode ter certeza que algo n√£o vai mudar nesse game, o ambiente assustador √© igual tanto para Claire como para Leon, uma coisa que me chama a aten√ß√£o √© o fato do ""gore"" ser bem vis√≠vel, se voc√™ atira na perna do zumbi ou no bra√ßo, dependendo do dano a parte atingida pode cair ou at√© ficar deformada, as marcas de tiros, facadas, explos√µes s√£o bem not√°veis. S√£o in√∫meros detalhes que deixam o jogo mais bonito, seja pelo gr√°fico fant√°stico ou mesmo pela modo de jogar mais lento, mais realista, ali√°s, realista no sentido de que voc√™ se sente mais humano em Resident Evil 2 em compara√ß√£o aos √∫ltimos t√≠tulos lan√ßados, me refiro a Resident Evil 6, 5 e 4. √â muito mais f√°cil ser morto nesse game, qualquer morto vivo pode te matar sem problemas se voc√™ n√£o prestar aten√ß√£o em pequenos detalhes como ter muni√ß√£o suficiente, ou at√© mesmo armas secund√°rias no invent√°rio como uma faca, granada, flash, etc.

O jogo √© cheio de quebra-cabe√ßas, voc√™ vai precisar ir e vir em v√°rios lugares, pegar chaves, achar melhorias para suas armas, abrir cofres com combina√ß√µes escondidas pelo mapa para poder ganhar mais espa√ßo no seu invent√°rio e claro que voc√™ faz tudo isso tendo que levar em considera√ß√£o diversos monstros pelo mapa incluindo o famoso ""Mr.X"". Agora, se voc√™ me perguntar que infernos √© Mr.X? Meu amigo provavelmente voc√™ n√£o est√° ligado nos diversos memes feitos com o ""garot√£o"" pela internet, enfim, Mr.X √© um Tyrant ou seja, ele foi criado para perseguir sobreviventes e eliminar evid√™ncias, ou seja, VOC√ä.
A sensa√ß√£o de correr pelos v√°rios corredores sendo perseguido por um brutamonte que n√£o morre nem a pau √© agoniante, a m√∫sica que come√ßa a tocar no momento em que voc√™ encontra ele √© muito bem feita e deixa uma sensa√ß√£o muito ruim no jogador, os passos do Tyrant podem ser ouvidos de longe e te ajudam a evit√°-lo, outra coisa que achei fant√°stica e amedrontadora ao mesmo tempo √© o fato de voc√™ poder ouvir quando o Tyrant abre portas em outra sala perto de voc√™, o jogador sabe que est√° sendo perseguido, ent√£o √© preciso levar em conta in√∫meros fatores enquanto se tem um objetivo em mente.

Digamos que voc√™ precisa de uma chave para abrir a porta B, mas para conseguir a tal chave voc√™ precisa achar uma ferramenta para destruir as correntes da porta A que fica em um quarto do outro lado do mapa para s√≥ ent√£o ter a chave em suas m√£os e fazer todo o caminho at√© a porta B novamente, isso √© claro contando com monstros, jumpscares (sustos), gerenciamento de invent√°rio (Se sua mochila ficar cheia de itens voc√™ se ferrou) e um Tyrant enorme correndo atr√°s, n√£o √© mole n√£o meu consagrado.

Quando voc√™ termina o game com Leon por exemplo, √© liberado um modo chamado de ""Second Run"" algo como um New Game +, √© a mesma campanha por assim dizer s√≥ que vista aos olhos do personagem no qual voc√™ n√£o jogou da primeira vez, o jogador terminou o game na primeira vez com Leon por exemploe agora vai poder jogar com a Claire nesse modo, l√° as coisas ser√£o um pouco diferentes, bosses mudam e os mesmos caminhos s√£o percorridos com outros objetivos em mente, alguns puzzles (quebra cabe√ßas) s√£o resolvidos de outra forma e o game n√£o muda completamente, mas fica parecendo um lado diferente da hist√≥ria.

Existem diversas outras ""mini"" hist√≥rias para voc√™ jogar quando termina a campanha principal, a mais divertida na minha opini√£o √© chamada de ""O quarto sobrevivente"" onde voc√™ √© um soldado da umbrella que ficou para tr√°s em Raccoon City e precisa chegar at√© o seu resgate. Algumas dessas mini hist√≥rias s√£o algo como ""E se..."" Ou seja, personagens que j√° morreram na campanha principal poderiam ter sobrevivido, ou seja, √© voc√™ que tentar√° mudar isso, s√£o modos de jogo mais simples e mais dif√≠ceis se me permite dizer, em um dos modos √© poss√≠vel ver mortos vivos usando mochilas, quando voc√™ abate algum deles eles derrubam itens importantes como muni√ß√£o, armas, etc.



*O cen√°rio √© bem sombrio e bota medo, ou seja, a proposta do game foi muito bem feita.
* A trilha sonora √© muito bem elaborada e ajuda muito no clima aterrorizante do jogo.
* Qualquer erro te leva a morte
* Voc√™ precisa gerenciar muito bem o seu invent√°rio para poupar tempo e evitar dores de cabe√ßa.
* Nunca tive tanto medo de um cara enorme com chap√©u na minha vida.
* O game possu√≠ v√°rios modos diferentes (reimagina√ß√µes e mini hist√≥rias diferentes) para voc√™ rejogar.
* Os gr√°ficos s√£o de tirar o f√¥lego, n√£o gosto de falar de gr√°ficos, nem detalhar tal coisa, n√£o considero gr√°ficos algo importante para recomendar ou n√£o um game, por√©m, √© importante dizer que Resident Evil 2 remake fez um trabalho fant√°stico quanto a esse aspecto.
* Sinceramente n√£o encontrei nenhum bug, ou pelo menos que eu pudesse notar.



* O jogo pode n√£o rodar extremamente bem, pode haver algumas pequenas quedas de frames dependendo do seu sistema operacional, eu praticamente n√£o tive problemas com isso, mas em alguns momentos era poss√≠vel notar a mudan√ßa de frames.



Recomendo sem problema algum, a proposta do game √© de um mundo sombrio e escuro, talvez at√© claustrof√≥bico em alguns momentos, se a inten√ß√£o era assustar o jogador e fazer com que ele ficasse sobre press√£o, os desenvolvedores conseguiram e muito bem. Mesmo que voc√™ j√° tenha jogado o game original eu posso afirmar que vale a pena, jogue novamente porque com certeza voc√™ vai amar, acredito que at√© aqui Resident Evil 2 √© o trabalho mais bonito feito pela Capcom recentemente.",Recommended," September 13, 2019"

Truely a Masterpeice of Survival Horror!, As a Resident evil veteran myself and HUGE fan of the original. i was not only challenged but increasingly challenged down to the last second of the game. Not only was it alot longer then the classic could ever be, but with the original soundtrack swap and the semi familiar area's it felt just like the classic but better, much better. Way Harder, way scarier and way more intense then the original could ever hope to be. And I only completed Leon's Story so far.. Cant wait too play the rest (I Wasnt sure about the huge changes too the entire RPD/Labs/Streets area before it was released, but i changed that tune real quick! ..it was....Perfect.)

This remake of Resident Evil 2 is a love letter to all HORROR genre games, especially to a SURVIVAL HORROR sub-genre. Capcom made this game with love. and think nothing else than brought this remake to see the day. Resident Evil 2 remake has all things that described the term of SURVIVAL HORROR, its SCARY - HORRIFYING - ATMOSPHERIC - BLOOD & GORE - ANXIETY PANIC SITUATION & LIMITED EQUIPMENT.

Well, Resident Evil 2 is a PERFECT example of how to do a video game remake & rebuilding it into a modern horror masterpiece. Every piece of this remake is brilliant and it‚Äôs a masterclass of their kind. Resident Evil 2 blends action, puzzles, and story into a well-balanced and fun to play. All this thing together makes this RESIDENT EVIL 2 remake as a strong contender for GAME OF THE YEAR in Steam Awards 2019. And maybe, a strong contender in GOTY nomination of THE GAMES AWARDS 2019 too.

Just experience, how Capcom beautifully craft this MASTERCLASS of HORROR.

the graphic is e x t r a n i c e that make me wish that i could do like RE7 FPP because everything is highly detailed the guts and wounds is just great

the bad part for me at least is the soundtrack, it doesn't deliver that well so just throw 3 dollens for original soundtrack and SFX well i know it shoulda been already in the game but well at least we got a good game to start in 2019

Oh this was good, very good. A wellcrafted love letter to the original story. This is how you do remakes right, this is how you do survival horror right, this is how you do adventure right.

While of course the game isn't entirely perfect, what is besides our grandparents cooking? It is so refined with an attention to detail that I am left lacking any substantive complaint.

I thoroughly recommend this if you are interested in any of the following
1. a fun adventure with tons of interconnected items/systems
2. a tight survival horror with plenty of tense moments and potential scares
3. an unforgettably polished revamp of a game that was already hard to forget. This game is the equivalent of John Carpenter's The Thing

What an excellent experience!

I just finished the Leon campaign and what a blast from the past! - The game manages to feel brand new and still deliver on a healthy dose of nostalga, Very well done!

I do have some critisims but don't let that detract from the fact this is a very good game and well worth the purchase price.
Frame Rate Dips. Most of the time I'm running steadily at 60fps (at 3440x1440 mind you!) but in a handful of locations on the map there is some unoptimised areas where I can dip as low as 45 - it's not game breaking but it was enough to pull me out of the atmosphere.

There are a bunch of cut scenes from the original that would have really helped with the length of the game, I finished Leon's campaign at just a hair under 5 hours and I wasn't rushing at all. I feel like I explored most of the areas to the fullest.

The controls on my Xbox pad were just too clunky for aiming, No idea how the guys on the consoles are managing, maybe they have some aim assist built in. I reverted to my Keyboard and mouse and this problem went away but then I was stuck with some fairly unintuitive controls by default, took me a while to get everything rebound to something like useful. Once I'd remapped though this was a non issue.

4. I found the default levels of Bloom and Motion Blur to be excessive, I had to spend a fair amount of time tweaking the (fairly impressive) settings to get everything looking right. There is also a lot of... er.. Shimmer? in some of the dark areas. This may have been due to my brightness settings though (I did turn those ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•es up, wanted to see the Z's coming! :D)

I had never played the original Resident Evil 2, so my expectations going into the remake were low but hopeful. With multiple modernized touch ups and quality of life enhancements, a 1:1 transition from original to remastered this ain‚Äôt, but what‚Äôs been lost from the old school has been gained with an excellent take on a well-established entry in the Resident Evil series. A welcome surprise was how Resident Evil 2 (mostly) avoids the folly of other horror games within the last few years: Leave all the scares to loud noises alone and make it a poorly disguised action game. Make no mistake that the game does have its segments of action, but it does so without losing sight of its original objective in being tense, exciting and worthy of repeated playthroughs.

The first major change that‚Äôll be noticed is the lack of the traditional overhead, locked camera angles and the inclusion of over the shoulder perspective/controls; essentially the norm with the series since Resident Evil 4. While this makes the player far more effective in combat, it does mean that in snug rooms and hallways that things become more claustrophobic, doubly so when enemies are within grabbing distance. Meandering through Raccoon City‚Äôs fallen police station is deliciously tense, with lighting and sound design going a long way to ensure the place is creepy - Not in the typical sense as skin-crawling, but in the sense of having you wonder if you‚Äôre in fact alone in a room - Or if you‚Äôll still be alone on the next pass. Zombies are gross and unsettling to look at, but it‚Äôs not their appearance that‚Äôll get to many players, it‚Äôs the zombies you CAN‚ÄôT see but can hear that‚Äôll get to you. Hearing sluggish steps and grumbling growls but not seeing the source of those noises ran my blood cold more often than I‚Äôd care to count. The game makes zombies a frightening concept again despite being lumbering cannon fodder.

This being a survival horror jaunt, it‚Äôs par for the course that ammunition and healing supplies will be tight across your playthrough, and even with the sharper combat, Leon and Claire aren‚Äôt experienced gunslingers. For most weapons, one must pause while aiming for the reticle to shrink in order to land a precise shot, otherwise it can land anywhere within the aimed zone. With that said, you can and you will miss those valuable headshots, even on the shamblers. The slight bob and weave they do will be just enough to throw you off, nevermind when there‚Äôs other dangers approaching. This leads immediately to my first issue in that zombies seemingly take a random amount of damage before they‚Äôre downed for good, plus the randomness for landing a critical headshot (head bursting). Other enemy types make it pretty clear when they‚Äôre down and out, but run of the mill zombies don‚Äôt have the same clarity unless their head has popped. While I agree that not knowing if a zombie isn‚Äôt done for good raises tension, to walk by and suddenly find that your characters‚Äô leg is being munched is irksome more than anything else. There‚Äôll be plenty of jumpy moments to fill the quota of scares, but Resident Evil 2 is more intimidating with its scares than being a in-your-face annoyance; a shrieking licker is enough to rattle anyone, but it's their flighty speed barreling towards you at full tilt that‚Äôs more frightening. A sub-boss marching its massive self towards you down a hallway while zombies are ready to get grabby has a knack for raising the heart rate.

Coming off the tails of Resident Evil 7, 2 also looks fantastic across the presentation board (even if Claire resembles little of her old incarnation). The only real grating thing about the game‚Äôs presentation is the voice-acting for the cast, those including the protagonists Leon and Claire. While the characters are fine, many of the actors come off as they were directed to read their lines dramatically but not within the context/emotion of the scene. I hesitate to use the word ‚Äòcamp‚Äô, but if anything, hearing the protagonists utter curses and complaints when aiming at a zombie is at best humorous and at worst silly. My heaviest issue comes with Chief Irons‚Äô depiction of being a creepy, violent abuser who has nothing in terms of redeeming qualities as a villain - A character designed to be a bad guy but not the kind that‚Äôs fun to boo. On the opposite end of that spectrum, seeing Ada back in action during Leon‚Äôs campaign as a super cool secret agent was a delight, especially in the brief time you get to play her‚Ä¶ But having to go through a dull, out of place stealth section in Claire‚Äôs campaign on the other hand was something I could‚Äôve gone without.

The map mechanic of marking passed items for later retrieval goes to show that, along with the other modern touch ups controls, that this isn‚Äôt a simple repainting of an original for the turn of a quick buck. It looks great, sounds great (sans voice acting) and plays great. With optional puzzles leading to inventory expansions and much-needed supplies, there‚Äôs a regular sense of progression even if you‚Äôll spend a good bit of time getting Racoon City‚Äôs station layout learned. The initial scare factor does wane with future playthroughs, but I‚Äôve already begun my third romp through the game and it‚Äôs still plenty enjoyable, especially as my skills sharpen. There‚Äôs also an assisted difficulty setting for those who need it (more of that please, devs!), alleviating a good chunk of the challenge since, near the end game, things can get rather rough. For those who enjoy horror games or shooters at a slower pace, this rendition of Resident Evil 2 gets my definite recommendation.",Recommended," March 1, 2019"

After few studios made remaster versions of many games, including Capcom & RE, now it's time for full remakes, i played RE2 when it was originally released in 1998 and it made me fall in love with the RE games, as much as people loving this remake it's not close to how phenomenal RE2 was in 1998, from the puzzles to the story ideas, at that time perfectly crafted by a team led by Shinji Mikami.

As a game in general, it's historic for being the 1st successful remake and it'll push studios to release new ones, a good idea so gamers can play amazing old games not easily accessible anymore.

Graphics, gameplay and sound are all great, the game looks incredible & the atmosphere is excellent. The puzzles are not hard, need a bit of logic.

I wont talk about the main story to avoid spoilers but a small tip, you have the option to start with Leon or Claire, they each have a bit of a different segments, but the story is close, what is important to do is that after you finish the game, a new game 2nd run option will open, when you choose it you'll start a new game from the perspective of the other character, and at the end of that run you'll witness the true ending of the game, 2nd run is shorter in general, not just story wise but also because you are familiar with the map now.

Overall the game isn't as ground breaking & historical as the original one but it's perfect for anyone who didn't play the original to play a pillar of the video games hall of fame, i would highly recommend it for any RE fans or horror or action adventure or gaming in general.",Recommended, April 22

A must buy game. Im not a fan of any Resident Evil games. But after playing this I can now. Forget about the negative review from the fans.

I never played a game that can literally have me sit on the edge playing it. The chase moments are reallg good. Zombies are powerful and nearly invincible. Puzzles are hard and I cant go forward wiyhout asking for help. If you played the ""Shining Lights Even in Death"" Metal Gear Solid V, this is the extension of it minus the puzzle.

This is coming from a classic fan who was butthurt over there not being fixed camera angles and no Alyson Court.

This game so far has blown me away, I couldn't care less about graphics but so far this game is drop dead gorgeous and brings back a true survival horror game. I have completed the original RE2 honestly probably hundreds of times and so far this game has made me peek every corner in sheer terror just hoping not to see even a corpse in case it wakes up.

So far this REmake has definitely hit the nail on the head with a REvamped police station with familiar but new scares that will even make the most experienced RE veteran feel scared. Playing on hardcore difficulty seems like the way to go so far if you want a true survival horror experience. I was worried that it would be too action packed without and backtracking and puzzles but I was fortunately surprised so far in this game. A true survival horror experience unlike most games that claim to be ""Survival Horror""",Recommended," January 25, 2019"

Edit: after a few more hours in I can confirm. Strong if not THE goty winner

I took a long time before I could even write this review. - TL,DR: What are you waiting for? Buy it!

I remember debating for the longest time with my best friend about why Resident Evil 2 would be the best remake we all needed. We fantasized about it for years and years and eventually gave up hope, more so because other legendary games failed us enormously (Metal Gear Solid V Phantom Pain I'm looking at you).

If you played the original you're in for a treat of goosebumps and shivers down your spine. Yes you will remember every single little thing and will smile at the nods to the trademark horror of two decades ago, but make no mistake this game will surprise you in ways you can't imagine.
If you're new to the series or at least the old school masters of horror you will experience an adventure of titanic proportions and I'm willing to bet my backside that you will find it refreshing and needed in today's game industry.

Camera, characters motion, enemies motion, setting, plot, sound design, gunplay, inventory management, visual design, you name it this game gets it right and astonishingly optimized to the point I believe it's the most fluid game I have played so far (my pc is quite capable to handle every game in ultra settings, what I mean is the devs managed to make the game experience and the game engine so fluid that it stands out from the crowd).

I'm mostly amazed that the devs managed to accomplish all of this in such a small package (game is about 22gb of space) while keeping the texture quality extremely high. Also the sound part of the game is above par, the wood cracks, footsteps, water drops and even distant rain are so polished I'm quite sure you will sometimes wonder if what you heard was in game or outside.

As for the extras included in the deluxe edition I haven't had the time to look into yet except for the original soundtrack swap which I think should be kept on always. Thing with the ""new"" soundtrack is that you don't get enough of it really, just about 30 seconds when you enter a room and that's it, whereas with the original swap you get a more dynamic flow between action and slow paced moments.

Right now my only question to Capcom is: now that you see how succesful this is, how long will it take for a Nemesis remake?",Recommended," January 25, 2019"

Resident Evil is a franchise whose entries are kind of hard to rate and compare with one another since the games have seen so much change over time. Despite all that, Resident Evil 2 Remake is an excellent game and a true successor to the original.


TL;DR:

+ Faithful reimagining of the original in every aspect.
+ Everything that could be improved in the original is improved in this game.
+ Meaningful gameplay mechanics. Everything has its use.
+ It is hardcore more than in just it's difficulty settings name. If you ask for challenging, unforgiving experience, you'll have it!
+ It makes your objective clear without holding your hand with markers.
+ Superb atmosphere and overall presentation.
+ All the little nods and homages to the original are very nice to a RE2 veteran like myself.

- More of a neutral than a negative point, but I feel like the characters look rather different than the ones from the original/followups.
- Although already great, the atmosphere would probably benefit from additional music tracks.
- I could do with more in-game unlockables.


OK so, let me start by saying that I'm a big fan and someone who knows RE inside and out. I've played all of the old games and I really loved what they did with RE4 afterwards. However I also loved RE6 (which is not a popular opinion) and I consider it to be RE game but also . However, no matter which style you prefer, you can't go wrong with Resident Evil 2 Remake.

This game, shortly put, does everything right!
The gameplay just works and manages to put a lot of pressure on the player and keep it going from start to finish. Whether you're being chased around the station by your nemesis, the terrifying tyrant or trying to sneak past a in a narrow hallway and hoping that the downed zombie doesn't suddenly grab your leg and mess up your entire sneaking attempt, . It successfully invoked the same uptight feeling within me that the original struck me with 20 years ago and reminded me what true survival horror is all about.

On top of all that, it looks wonderful and the games visuals successfully add to the horror.
Without going into detail and revealing the games locations, I'll stick to the police station and it's dark, flooded hallways with narrow passages where the zombies roam free. The game does darkness and shadows right. Your flashlight is absolutely necessary in some areas and when combined with the games light-dark ratio it creates amazing environments.
I've seen that some users were writing that they had problems with the lighting but I had none of that. The game has very detailed brightness settings (3 of them in fact) and improper calibration was probably the cause of the problem.

In traditional RE fashion, going through the game once is not really going to count as a full experience.
Luckily for us, this title has quite the replay value - just like the original had. Completing the game with either of the characters will unlock the for the other character which is a replay of the game with quite a few things changed. From objectives and progression to enemies, things will be different enough to keep you interested. The maps are the same for the most of these two runs but the way you play and progress through these will be quite different.

Unfortunately, compared to the original game there isn't that much extra content.
Besides the there are no other game modes at the moment although I've heard that some will be added as a free DLC. There are some extra weapons and original costumes that you can unlock but that's it. It's not bad but I kind of hoped they would add more of these but, we never know what might be in the upcoming updates.


Finally I'd like to give a definite YES to this game, congratulate the entire RE2 Remake team on a job wonderfully done. Now I can only hope that this one sells good enough so that one day we might get a remake of even better quality.",Recommended," January 28, 2019"

I love and hate this game! This is my first time I ever played an Resident Evil game, and man I truly loved it! The story was very interesting, the horror level was quite good (mostly because of the zombies that are getting in your face out of nowhere and the loud noises), the bosses are at a decent level of difficulty (at least on standard mode) and the ending (the last ending with Claire) was soooo good and satisfying! But... But... The thing that made me hate this game and didn't let me sleep well at night, was... The son of a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Tyrant/Mr.X...

January 21, 1998 a horror classic was unleashed to the world.
When I say Resident Evil 2 revolutionized the horror genre it would be an understatement, the music, atmosphere, gameplay and graphics at the time were out of this world. Imagen my reaction when I found out that there was a remake in the making, all sort of ideas popped into my head,
Is it going to be a faithful recreation of the original game, are they going to add something new, is it first person and what about the music??....................That was in 2016.
Fast-forward 2 years ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. the game was released.

The Review

‚Ä¢ Gameplay

The game takes the resident evil 4 camera approach ‚Äúa behind the shoulder camera ‚Äúand that made the game horrifying and intense. The movement speed of the characters is slower than what I would have liked but it won‚Äôt ruin the experience for anyone in fact, it‚Äôs the opposites, every time you encounter an enemy it can add to the overall feeling of dread.
All in all, gameplay for me is a solid 9/10.

‚Ä¢ Graphics

The Re engine gave this game a new life in this day and age. The realistic graphics that this engine provides adds to the sense of dread and fear surrounding you in every corner whether it‚Äôs the lighting, the details of every enemy monster, the character models‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
This is too good to be true 10/10.

‚Ä¢ Music

The Resident evil series was always known for its amazing soundtrack especially RE2 and 4 but, strangely enough the remake doesn‚Äôt seem to have any music at all except for the boss battles and the lovely safe room, they all have their own themes.
Capcom choose to focus on the ambient sound and that resulted in the game having an atmosphere that is petrifying ,you can‚Äôt just go and open any door or stroll without thinking about the screams you hear‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.yeah and one last thing I almost sh** my pants because of the f****** footsteps.
The overall sound design gets a 9/10.
Side note try the original soundtrack.

‚Ä¢ Performance

I ran the game using a GTX 1070 on max preset 1440p.Performance wise, the game is optimized and runs like a dream. There is all kind of settings if you want to tweak the game to your liking.
Performance gets 10/10.

‚Ä¢ Final Verdict

Capcom succeeded in recreating a horror classic that was remembered for its terrifying atmosphere, monsters, music and replayability. It seems that capcom is trying its best to please its fans and reclaim the reputation that it once had by making the game that the fans always dreamed of.
In the end, I would have given the game a 9/10 if I weren‚Äôt a fan of the series ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs a solid 10/10 this is how you remake a game.",Recommended," April 17, 2019"

Resident Evil 2 back in 1998 was a game that terrified the masses and youngins alike making them fear the undead and empty police stations. As you first gain control of leon and run through the streets of raccoon city at the beginning of the game. You feel overwhelmed by everything around you, you begin to panic. Then for the rest of the game you continue to feel that sense of panic and fear. Hoping for a save point. In 2019 that feeling is still alive and kicking. With RESIDENT EVIL 2 REMADE from the ground up using CAPCOMS in house RE Engine giving off fantatsic atmosphere and an extreme sense of dread. You are constantly under stress. In this case that is a good thing. As you wander the halls of the abandoned police station you can hear the groans of zombies in other rooms, the screeches and scuttles of the lickers and the stomping footsteps of someone I won't spoil here. The R.P.D. is reborn for the 21st century in beautiful fashion. The remade third person controls feels like the fast paced gameplay of the beloved RESIDENT EVIl 4 combined with the original clastrophobic feeling of RESIDENT EVIL 2 without taking away from the horror elements. The faster paced 3rd person style gives you a sense of familiarity, still you feel helpless to all the threats you face, inculding the zombies. RE2 Remake has taken zombies and analyzed them and wanted to make you fear them again. RE2 succeeds in this aspect of the game.You can shoot off heads, limbs, and even split them in half! But they still come at you relentlessly with or without a way to get their hangs on you. When they do, the camera zooms in giving you a closed in and clostrophobic feeling as the zombie tears into your flesh. The original elements of Resident Evil is still alive. Combining herbs to make healing items and combining gunpowder to make more ammunition to keep the undead away. The game makes you feel powerful but really you are powerless. You never truly feel like you have enough ammo, therefor scavenging through the rooms and halls of the R.P.D. is a given.

Resident Evil 2 allows you to play as either Claire Redfield, a college student looking for her brother Chris Redfield, or Leon S. Kennedy a rookie cop heading towards his first day at the R.P.D. they meet at a gas station swarming with creatures they have never seen before. Zombies! So they escape into raccoon city hoping to find safety in the Raccoon City Police Department. Unluckily for them, the entire city is swarming with zombies! Then the nightmare begins. RESIDENT EVIL 2 makes great use of the two playable chracters with what the fans call the A and B scenarios. These change the predicaments the player gets into with the character they play as. For example when beating the game once as Leon. You can then play through the game a second time with Claire to get her side of the story. Although the game as a whole in the B playthrough is mostly the same. The game makes up for this changing enemy spawn locations, key item locations, and other materials and ammunition are in different places around the map. You also get to see different character sub plots, different weapons and different upgrades for those weapons depending on which character you choose. Which one is your favorite?

Resident Evil 2 uses a fantastic audio sysetm called buniural audio or 3D audio for some. This is only good for the game because you can hear every little sound in the R.P.D. The groans of zombies looming behind you, or the lumbering footsteps of the absolutly terrifying Mr.X, also know as the tyrant. This really makes you feel like you are really there with leon or claire the whole way through. This is a big plus for the game, good horror needs good audio.

The game also features extra modes that allow for more replayability and more scares even after the story is over making this game even more worth the buy. If you are a fan of survival horror that is.

As much as I could talk on and on and on about how much I and many others love this game. But there is no game without its issues. The game has some lighting issues on console but on PC I had no issues myself.

I can not reccommend this game enough for survival horror , and zombie game fans. Its one hell of a ride and I don't want to talk about it anymore. Just buy this game, it is expertly crafted, beautifully designed and will scare the S@$T out of you. This game shines a bright future (or maybe a dark one if you catch my meaning.) on the Resident Evil franchise.",Recommended," February 19, 2019"

A straight up masterpiece and a worthy successor to the original game.

It's not 100% accurate to the original version, but that's a good thing. It mixes it up so that us veterans aren't going to know the exact situation and solutions right off the bat, but it's similar enough that knowing the original will help keep you from getting lost. Gameplay uses modern design, but doesn't make things easy. In place of static camera angles they use light (or lack there of) to hide things. Yes, it's over the shoulder with 3rd person shooting controls, but your aim is a bit wobbly, and enemies stagger in non-predictable ways. Also, your aim gets better if you stand still for a second, so yeah, you can move while you shoot now, but it's not very useful.

My only complaint is that A/B playthroughs aren't consistent with the story, and if this is the new canon there's some holes to fill in (but that just means that the mystery is back!)

Honestly, if you're a fan of horror games at all, especially the Resident Evil's that are actual horror and not just action games, BUY THIS GAME.",Recommended," February 7, 2019"

After a long period of time playing the game, I can say that it's worth the price, and even if you don't pay for the deluxe, it will be the same experience; learn from Capcom stupid Activision.

I will start pointing everything I have to say within sections.

Story: It's the RE 2 story, nothing has changed. It has good and deep lore if you read the letters, and you can know what caused the spread of the virus. it's a good place to start playing the entire franchise (if you want).
The only bad thing about this game is that it has 8 hours of gameplay at most. But the good thing is that you have 2 stories, so it doesn't matter.

Replay Value: This is like the best part of the game, it's like RE 4, you can play it more than once and it will be funny anyways.
I recommend you playing the New Game 2 (or +) if you want to know the real ending, and if you want to know more lore you can play the New Game 2 twice.
And you have the new content that it's gonna be in the game as free DLC, so go for it.
(And the 4th Survivor and the Tofu survivors if you're a crazy (B)itch that wants the 100%).

Camera: People says that if it doesn't have the old RE 2 camera, it's a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, but they're wrong, it's the same, and even more scary sometimes, because the ambientation. it's so well made... and it's inmersive as hell.

Ambientation: It's as good as you can see on the screenshots, it's not a clickbait ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• like the, The Division downgrade, or Rainbow Six, and etc, the graphics are like that. they're zones scary as hell, that makes you turn on the lights and hesitate if you want to go to the next room or not. Like the original. I can say that the ambientation it's so good, that it makes me want to walk in the game, just to see the details that it has.
They made a good job with the scary zombies in different places that makes you want to run like a (B)itch. MR X does a good job with that too, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing your mind with every step you take, because, run a little bit and you're screwed.


Zombies: The zombies in this game are creepy, as you would imagine, there is nothing more to say about them, just the things that cost like 6 9mm bullets to kill them, his heads are really overpowered. but that's not a thing to hate the game. people just makes bad points to hate this game, just because it's a remake or something like that.
but it's fine for me that the zombies are like that, they need to scare you in some way, and they need to give you the sensation of defenseless to make you scream like a baby if one of them appears and you don't have ammo, for example.
The lickers are good for the ambientation too, but sometimes they can be a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, because they're in a small area on the floor waiting you, and if you don't have anything to defend yourself you're screwed too.
And (F)uck the one shot plant-like zombies. That was the unfair thing of this game.


Difficulty: In this case, I just played standard, and I can't make a point about hardcore, because it looked a little annoying to enjoy, so I will play it later.
This difficulty it's ok I guess, it isn't like ""holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it's too balanced"" or something like that, because sometimes the game it's too generous, but it's okay because not everyone is as good as other people. But the thing that I can say it's that, it will be scary anyways, so if you aren't a player that knows everything about this game, standard will be fine for almost everyone. And if you don't know how to aim just use the easy mode.


Optimization: The game runs too good to be true. With a GTX 1070ti and a I5 4690 I get 80-120fps with an avg of 100 with all maxed out and with the resolution at 120%.
You can run this game at 25-40fps with low settings at 1080p with a RX 550 so don't hesitate if you have something better than that.


Graphics: I can't say much about this, you have to see the screenshots by yourself. Some textures are low detailed even on max texture settings tho, but that doesn't make them bad at all.

Outstanding Remake

CAPCOM has outdone themselves with this remake, modernizing everything without losing the atmosphere and the nostalgia from the original, the quality really exceeded my expectations.

+ Proper PC port: Plenty of settings, ultra-wide support and great optimization.
+ Stunning visuals and very atmospheric
+ The balance of horror, puzzles and action is perfect

~ The amount of unlockables and the high replayability makes this heaven for Completionists and speed runners.

Never thought I would be playing RE2 again. Great comeback, fantastic remake. Reimagining of old-school gem with absolute respect to the original.

Devs managed to create the game which appeals both to the early fans with actual survival atmosphere, often challenging difficulty and those who like more new-age RE with 3rd person camera angle and satisfying combat. I would say it's an improvement over original as it feels less silly, much more gritty and difficult due to difficulty balance, great voice acting and better written characters.

The only issue, which can be a major one for oldschool players, is that there's very little continuity and content for A/B runs (First run / Second run in RE2 Remake).

One of the most fun experiences I've ever had with a video game. So many moments where I was screaming for my character to actually move their legs away from danger, but instead it feels liek they just want to crawl at a snails pace.

The feeling of having every bullet, grenade and melee weapon count has you on guard at all times in fear of an encounter where your only options are to run away or run though it and hope you make it by the skin of your teeth.

I've never played anything from the Resident Evil series until today and I think I'll do what I can to play through the others (once I'm done with RE2: Remaster of course)!

By the time of writing this review I've finished the first run scenario with Claire. Got to the game through AMDs reward program.

I hardly remember the original Resident Evil 2. I've played it a little and watched other people play it, but it was years ago and I was too little to properly understand what was going on. However, I've got to say that this is hands down the best RE game I've ever played, and I've played every other main title. In fact, I was so hyped for this game that I played every other resident evil just to know how everything would be connected. And I don't regret it.

The graphics and details are incredibly good. I was worried that it'd make the same mistake as Resident Evil 6, with pitch black areas that had no way to be fixed and you just had to go around based on the map. The RE engine does incredibly well, and I believe that even capcom is aware of that considering that they're using the same engine for all their games now. It looks very polished, the facial animations are very beautifully done and the models are really good. The zombies look realistic and terrifying and you can see the effect every bullet you shoot at them has. It also runs very well, giving me almost twice the frames I expected it to, which shows the good optimisation of the game. There are a few issues here and there, but they're minimal and only if you're being nitpicky as I am, trying to look at every single detail for hours.

The gameplay is just as good. There are many, many puzzles in the game, and they're all very satisfying and sometimes challenging to solve. There are times when you suddenly realise that the item you have is for the thing you found hours ago, and it feels good to do detective work. Speaking of which, there is quite a lot of backtracking if you want to get everything with your limited inventory, but it wasn't an issue for me. The best part of the game in my opinion was however the mini side quest with Sherry, which was incredibly dark and scary and sort of felt more like an Outlast game. The enemies have a lot of variety, and your arsenal against them also has a lot of variety to ensure you use them all. There's a chance that you'll miss some things throughout the game, but the map shows you when there's something to be done in a room which is helpful for finding everything. Not to mention that it shows all the items. I generally don't use maps that much, but I used it every other minute in this game. The chase scenes were the best part of the game to me, along with times when you're overwhelmed. They give you a massive feeling of hopelessness and it's satisfying to escape, even if you know that you will be found sooner or later. The normal zombies and especially for me, the dogs and in the open areas such as the beginning of the game can get stuck sometimes which is a shame but it's not the biggest complaint.

The story was also very good. I didn't expect too much, but honestly, I was very immersed and hooked. I liked reading every bit of lore and while it wasn't the most insanely complex, I still had an emotional attachment to the characters. It was satisfying and it was truly scary and anxiety-inducing at times.

The music is as good as you'd expect. There are the original tracks to use if you're interested in them, but I loved the remastered audio and found it to be as terrifying as it should be, and sometimes quite heroic and epic. It was just right, based on the scenes and if I can find a place to get it I will gladly do so.

TL;DR, if you like resident evil, you'll love this. If you don't, there's a high chance you'll still love this.

EDIT: I've played and finished scenario B for Leon and I've got to say that there are many story differences and conflicts which may be confusing at first. However, I found the story to be much more mature, darker and perhaps more ""action and mystery focused"", although that doesn't mean much considering the game's overall atmosphere and gameplay mechanics. I found Leon's side to be very interesting despite my expectations and while I preferred Claire's scenario A ending, it was a good twist and certainly added a ton of replayability, considering that now I want to play the game twice more just to experience absolutely everything, and that doesn't even include the fantastic 4th Survivor and the hilarious Tofu mode.",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

This is how you do a Remaster right!

The story of the game follows Leon Kennedy, a first day police officer, who has to witness a deeper fear than excpected. You also get to take the role of Claire Redfield, a girl who is in search of her brother, Chris Redfield, who took part in the Spencer Estate incident.

The story intertwines numerous times as you proceed through the deeper horrors of what's going on in Raccoon City.

Resident Evil 2 Remaster adds tons of new horror to the classic Resident Evil 2. Every step you take has to be calculated for your survival, as you have a towering presence chasing you althrough the entire game.

I recommend playing on Hardcore. The game is hard as it is, but hardcore removes the comfort of autosaves, and truly makes you concider who you actually shoot. Remember, you dont get experience from killing zombies, you need to save every bullet you have. Good luck",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

I don't usually get scared by games unless they consist only of jumpscares but this game is absolutely terrifying. The atmosphere is perfect and the weight placed on you due to the big lack of ammo and feeling of helplessness is just perfect.

Don't let anyone tell you that this game isn't good because it embodies every good thing that resident evil should be and it looks stunning with the settings all the way up.

Childhood Memories w/ HD textures

Ahh...Resident Evil 2. One of the first games I ever played at a friend's house, at the ripe old age of nine. I still get nervous playing the classic game, because it left such an impression on me. Even when I stepped foot into the first area of Raccoon Police Department I can still hear the beautiful, yet unsettling ""Front Hall"" theme. The fact that the game was on two discs, because it was so big at the time was borderline impressive. We'd wait for my friend's brother to come home and turn the game on, because we didn't know how to solve some of the puzzles and we really struggled to get far. No one really had any guides back then, outside of a crappy monthly released paper-based cheat and hint book that rarely had any solutions for the games that you played. Took us many weeks or even months to ""get good"" at the game, learn how to run through certain enemies, how to conserve ammo and unlock various secrets, like the unlimited ammo weapons or cool outfits.

And now, after 21 years we get a remake. An actual remake, not just an updated version with better textures, but a new 3rd person camera perspective, a brand new engine that was used to restart the whole franchise with Resident Evil 7.



One of the best things about the game is that it has such a modular approach to graphics. You can tweak pretty much any aspect of the visuals to your own preference/system capabilities. Also a welcome function, which I wish more developers would add, is that all the options explain what something does with a VISUAL explanation. Since many people sometimes are not too familiar with the technobabble that those settings entail. Zombies look fantastic, with locational damage to their limbs, altering their animations and action patterns. Gore is also sublime, and purposefully designed to be part of the game, rather than just be gore for the sake of gore. Personally, the game is running very well for me (i7 8700k+GTX 1070TI) and I cannot complain. Streaming the game on my Samsung 4K TV via SteamLink I always get 60fps on a 1440p resolution. Pretty sure if I tinkered with the settings enough, I could get it to run at 4K@60fps, since as I mentioned previously, the amount of options that you tweak is more than enough to find a balance of what you want and can use. On my regular desktop monitor, the game runs at a steady 144fps without any problems. Oh and don't worry about the listed memory usage, it doesn't come near what's shown, when you actually use tools to record memory usage.



Playing with a 5.1 surround setup, the game feels appropriately tense in audio as well. You can hear various ""little"" sounds behind you, and the fact that now zombies can enter through doors and follow you just adds to the tension when you hear random sounds behind you. Music is outstanding. Game knows when to accelerate game audio accordingly to what's happening on the screen and it helps to increase the urgency, when you get attacked by formidable enemies that require more effort than regular zombies. Zombie groans and screeches feel unnerving, and sometimes feel outright feral, to a point where you doubt if it's even a zombie, and might be a new unseen enemy.



No more tank controls, more freedom and improved control design for various items in your inventory. Ammo is scarce and zombies are difficult to put down, unless you smash their head in completely. Even if you remove multiple limbs off a zombie, they can still pose a threat. ""Aim for the head"" was never more true, and since this is basically a motto for any type of zombie media - at least it feels genuine here. Zombies are a lot more deadlier and their lunges are harder to avoid. You are always given a choice to kill or leave them, but leaving them also has a chance of encoutering more than one of them in the same sport later on. No more blood puddles to tell you when a zombie is dead. Locations are similar to the original, including the map layout. However the key items are different, so even if you are a master speed-runner of the original game, you'll still need to learn a lot of new stuff here. Knife is actually quite useful in combat now, since it has more utility. It requires some skill and timing, but the reward is that you can effectively run away from a zombie, without wasting ammunitition This will definitely add a layer of strategy to harder difficulty runs. I've still yet to get all the weapons in the game, but all of them feel unique and fill a specific damage role for different enemy types, which is always welcome in a supposed survival-horror game.



Well, it's essentially the same story from the original game, albeit with updated voice acting, animation work and a lot more emphasis on cinematic presentation. I never really cared too much on story in Resident Evil games, but RE2 had a solid and well-paced story with interesting characters, not to mention that you also had 2 different perspectives and some little choices that affected the other character in their respective save file. Resident Evil games rely more on fanservice, rather than a ""good"" story.





- Multiple graphics options to choose from with visual reference and well optimized.
- Less action focused, more reliant on atmosphere and a solid pacing.
- Managed to bring back the classic feel of RE2 to an updated format in a 3rd person perspective.
- Zombies are more varied, in terms of behavior. Act according to their limb damage (to a certain degree).
- Similar layout of the locations, but the key items and puzzles are different and new.
- Controls are fluid, responsive and aiming even with a controller feels great.
- Character animations are top-notch.
- Gunpowder crafting from Resident Evil 3 is back.
- Being chased by Mr. X - appropriate levels of anxiety.
- Replay value and multiple playthroughs.
- Hardcore difficulty requires tactical thinking and planning.



- Wesker's Handgun that you get with the Deluxe Edition (or buy separately). When wielding it gives you damage protection, which allows you to take an extra hit in Hardcore mode. That's huge considering that you die in 2 hits most of the time. Items like these need to be unlockable - not a bonus if you pay for it.
- Handgun sounds are all identical, even if there are 7-8 different pistols in the game. Even the .45 ACP caliber weapons sound the same that you get in B scenarios.
- The classic soundtrack from the original Resident Evil 2 is a DLC, and if you want to use it in-game, you'll need to buy it or instead get the Deluxe Edition. Not a fan of these type of practices. Why not let us unlock the soundtrack after beating the game?
- Wish there was an option to use a laser sight. I got so used to it throughout all these types of games. From Dead Space 1-3 and I think it was one of the best features about the wacky RE4-RE6 phase, because quite literally it added another layer of depth.
- Boss fights are essentially the same from the original classic RE2 - mechanically speaking. Just a big monster flailing around.



I've been anticipating the Resident Evil 2 remake for years now. Probably since they released the 2002 GameCube version of RE:Remake and was really hoping to see an updated version for Resident Evil 2. During the more disappointing transition from Resident Evil 5-6, I did not expect CAPCOM to even bring Resident Evil back to the original template. My guess is that the fanfare that they received after updating Resident Evil 0-1 in HD and releasing them on PC/XBOX/PS and ""rebooting"" the franchise with the latest Resident Evil 7 release, showed why people loved Resident Evil and gave them the necessary feedback to further invest on the classic formula that started back in 1996.

Now, here's hoping they bring back the adventures of Jill Valentine in RE3 Remake.",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

Resident Evil 2, the remake of the original 1998 survival horror classic of the same name, is a reimagining that lives up to the legacy of its precursor, updating experimenting with many of the hallmarks of the Resident Evil series as well as with survival horror on the whole. It has some major shortcoming for those willing to nitpick, but make no mistake, the game is absolutely worth it for long time fans of the genre or the series.

Taking place in Raccoon City, the game tracks the daring misadventures of two unlikely heroes, rookie cop Leon Kennedy and action heroine Claire Redfield, as the two attempt to survive a zombie outbreak created by, spoiler, the Umbrella Corporation. The remake here hits all the same beats as the original: rescuing a little girl named Sherry, rendezvousing with the mysterious Ada Wong, and so on. However, new life has been breathed into all of these characters. Ada Wong's motivations are less murky and offer her character more depth, for example. (Personally, I found the expansion of Chief Irons to be positively chilling.) There is one unfortunate quirk about the writing in , but I'll return to that in a bit.

Meanwhile, one can't talk about updates to the game without talking about the updated gameplay. No longer played from fixed camera angles, features an over-the-shoulder camera with greater precision in aiming weapons and an emphasis on crowd management and dismembering zombies (an especially useful tactic, since actually zombies proves unexpectedly difficult). While some of the clever subtext and deliberate staging of the original game is lost, the overall effect is wonderful, creating a much more believable version of the police station and secret labs. The gritty realism on display does wonders to drive home the body horror and grotesqueries of Raccoon City. Plus, I would be remiss if I didn't at least mention the inclusion of the ever menacing Mr. X, a hulking behemoth that actively stalks you through the station; many people have pointed out just how intimidating a presence he offers to the game, and his more active role in the remake really breathes life into the experience.

But with these changes and permutations come two major problems, and by the end of my playtime, they were enough to put a real damper on my experience. The first is the use of adaptive difficulty. I won't lie; I'm not very good at video games. Having said that, while I the rationale behind increasing the difficulty to keep tension high, the way it's implemented makes the game feel as if it's arbitrarily punishing for cautious play. A fixed difficulty option would be nice, but that's far from my main complaint about .

No, oddly, my biggest problem with the game is also one of its major assets: the writing. While the game is a marked improvement over the original title in terms of nuance and performance, it feels a tad emotionally hollow, as if going through the motions of a dramatic story without any real interest in things outside of looking scary and/or cool. I found myself thinking back to another game that I think is remaking the original , Tango Gameworks's . While goes out of its way to explore the inner demons and fears of its main characters, both sympathizing with and being critical of its cast, the characters of seem...flat, with no real insight or reflection on who these characters are past simply their more self-evident quirks. That's not inherently a bad thing, but it does mean that after hours of play, it can be hard to find oneself very invested in the plot of a game that's telling a story we heard 20 years ago.

And that's really the crux of the problem here. is a game that looks backwards while stepping forwards with the most impressive technology and polish that AAA development can buy. However, these might well be problems that many a player can look over; after all, not everyone is as bad at games as I am, and I tend to be more picky when it comes a game's writing. At the end of the day, it's good, (I'd even go as far as to suggest that this is definitive version of the story.) and I absolutely recommend it to both fans of survival horror and fans of . It isn't without its problems, but it is, nevertheless, a game experience presented with incredible care and attention to detail.",Recommended," March 16, 2019"

Great game. Could be a strong candidate for GotY. The only thing I'm not too fond of is the ""dumbed downness"" of it. Even in Hardcore mode you can see items on the mini map. And even the needed key to unlcok a door. I also DON'T need green and red highlighted words when reading documents to tell me the important sections.

RESIDENT EVIL 2 is a survival horror and a remake of the cult classic, which I sadly haven't played. So this is a new game for me. It doesn't feel cheap like many other remasters and remakes do nowadays, where they just change textures, put a bigger price tag and call it a day. This looks and plays like any modern game. They've replaced classic Resident Evil controls and camera with a more modern third-person view and aiming system. This makes boss-battles more fun than in previous game, now you have to actually aim and if you're not good enough you can run out of ammo before the bossfight ends. Luckily the game has a very good balance, so you'll probably will never run out of ammo in the middle of bossfight, unless you do something wrong.

This game improves on everything the first part featured. It has more zombies, more locations, more bossfights and more interesting story. Like in the first one, you can choose a character before you start the game. You can play either as Leon, a rookie police officer on his first day in Raccoon city, or Claire, a biker girl, who's looking for her brother Chris (protagonist of the first game). Just like in the first one there is a different story depending on which character you choose to play as. Though apart from the story those campaigns feel the same. In the first one, each character had a special object, Jill had a lockpick and Chris had a lighter, also Jill's inventory was bigger. In this game there's no difference between characters apart from guns they use and a couple of puzzles, which are supposed to be different, but they feel very similar.

After completing the game as either of those characters, it unlocks a new mode called ""second run"" for the second character. It's supposed to explain what the other character was doing during events you experienced in the first run. Completing second run is required to get a true ending. So in total there are 4 campaigns with minor differences. After beating those you also unlock 4th Survivor mode, where you play as Umbrella operative who's trying to get out of the sewers. This a mad dash through locations, you've seen on your previous runs, but they are filled with zombies and you have no time to explore. It's a very hard mode, which adds a lot of replayability to the game.

On the presentation side, the game has very realistic graphics and smooth animations. Zombies are most fun in this game, you can shoot off their limbs and they will behave differently. The most fun thing is that most of the zombies can be avoided, you can run around them or just walk quietly hoping they won't notice you. A lot of effort was put into those zombies there are a lot of different models and their detalization is superb.


+ Realistic graphics
+ Interesting story
+ Replayability value
+ Zombies are most fun
+ Memorable locations


- Stories that supposed to happen at the same time are full of plotholes
- Differences between different campaigns are very small

So far this is my favourite game in Resident Evil series. Even though this game is a sequel, it can be played without knowing the story of the first one or zero.

Capcom did a fantastic job of resurrecting all the best parts of the classic Resident Evil 2 and making them look, sound, and play like a 2019 game. If you‚Äôre of the mind that the series had lost its way for a while there, this game is very much a return to form. The zombie combat is satisfying and exploring the dilapidated ruins of Raccoon City is a thrill. The one big letdown is that the two characters‚Äô stories aren‚Äôt different enough to make the second playthrough as rewarding as the first, even after unlocking the 2nd Game mode.

Capcom finally redeeming the Resident Evil saga by remaking the classic Resident Evil 2 is a great step towards the future of Resident Evil ( including, of course, Resident Evil 7 ) .

The amount of hard work and respect they put into this game is astonishing and i frankly can't wait for the remake of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. The game features , like the original , 2 main campaigns where you play as Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield, unlocking the B scenarios once you've completed them. While the B scenarios don't differ much from the A scenarios, the whole experience is more than satisfying. The technical performance of this game is overall phenomenally done, the gameplay is engaging and fun and the music and story are great. The enemies are well designed and while the A.I. might not the best , some of the encounters can be truly terrifying ( such as the Lickers or the infamous Mr. X ).

Once you've finished the stories you can always try the iconic 4th Survivor and Tofu Survivor modes which are pretty entertaining and even more content will be available with the upcoming Ghost Survivors free DLC's.

Overall, this remake was an incredibly pleasant surprise , totally recommended to every Resident Evil fan.

One of my favourite single-player games to date.

A highly anticipated release for the beginning of 2019, and a definite fan favourite to existing RE players and new players to the franchise. The re-imagined version of RE2 has many changes from the original; some would say its for the better, some would say its for the worse. It all boils down to personal opinion, because this game has everything that a true survival horror, RE game, should have. Be sure to enter this game with a fresh state of mind.

This game was not designed to be a zombie horde shooter like many of the zombie games out there. The zombies in this game are bullet sponges. They take multiple shots to down, and its all randomized; sometimes one shot to the head, sometimes a full magazine and then some. It leaves you wondering if you have enough ammo to kill that zombie, or simple juke by it.

Full of puzzles with clues that are scattered throughout to help you accomplish them. The map design and quests are entertaining. There is a lot of backtracking in this game, to promote a healthy understanding of the map for future quests. Map and route knowledge is very important. If you dont know where youre going, you can put yourself between a rock and a hard place very easily.

The gameplay is smooth. There is no dodge button, so you‚Äôll have to get good at dodging zombie attacks, quickly. Inventory is limited as with any RE game, so item management is key.

Everything in this game looks great. The textures are very modern, and theres a great update to the character design. The dialog is sub-par, but the voice acting is not all that bad. The DLC has some cool skins as well. There is a community of modders out there that have done some custom work, so be sure to check those out. There is also a lot of swearing in the game, which may not appeal to parents with younger players.

The length of the game can vary for players. Many say that this game has catered to speed runners, and that is partially true, and may even be involuntarily (or purposely) implemented into the game, as completion times, on the highest difficulty, are imperitive to unlocking the ‚Äúfun‚Äù infinite ammo weapons and some achievements. You can definitely take your time playing each play through, as those infinite weapons are nothing more than an optional goal for yourself in future completions, or if you want to take your results to .

Being one of the more expensive games on the market, this one is very worth it if youre into multiple playthroughs, and replaying within the same (or similar) environment. There is a total of 4 separate playthroughs that share some of the same puzzles, and the stories are not in canon with each other. This may be a negative to many players, but the initial key factors that make up the original RE2 are still there. There is also extra modes called Ghost survivors and 4th Survivor, that features returning characters like Hunk and Kendo.

I‚Äôd definitely recommend this to anyone interested in a good survival horror, inventory management, game. Your first initial play-through will be between 5-10 hours, if you take your time. Keep in mind that speed runners can finish the game in under 2 hours, and in about 3 hours if everything is collected. If youre looking for a zombie shooter, like Killing Floor or Left 4 Dead, or looking for a verbatim story from the 1998 version, you will be disappointed.",Recommended," March 26, 2019"

This is where the fun begins. It is absolute masterpiece and released as top quality game, definitely worth to buy. With the original soundtrack DLC was like time machine right into 1998, where all my memories and feelings came back. There is rumored, that later new content will be added. It's a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. Let's not forget the other great titles like RE3 or Dino Crisis 1-2 and hope Capcom will continue doing a good job.

So after completing both scenarios for Claire and A for Leon plus playing the spectacular ""4th Survivor"" game mode. I'm ready to share my review for the game.

RE:2 remake not only does the original justice it goes above and beyond, I never expected the game to have this level of brilliance. I'm utterly blown away by what they've done to an all time classic in a good way. RE:2 is by all means one of the best survival horror games I've played in many a years. The game lets you play how you want too. You don't need to pick up that grenade launcher or shotgun. The most notable mention has to be for Mr X, a truely iconic nemesis in RE:2 that stalks you throughout the game (he arrives sooner on scenario B so be ready). Hearing his thuds and the music when he's getting close is just chilling.

The 4th Survivor mode on it's own is just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing awesome. You play as HUNK trying to escape the horror, you're dodging a bucket load of enemies including lickers, sewer creatures and Mr X himself. The game does give you a full inventory of meds, weapons and ammo so used them wisely as you cannot pick up anything throughout the game. The music that plays keeps you pumped up and on edge.

Resident Evil fan or someone wanting to jump into the series, this is the best time. Rumors of a RE:3 remake are rife right now and if true we're in for something real nice based off what they did with RE:2. This game deserves a 10/10 rating.

So, where do I start? I've been a huge fan of the Resident Evil series since I was a child, even though the games scared the hell out of me. I kept playing and I'm even one of the few people who enjoy the later games (4,5,6). But going by this one? Well, Resident Evil 2 was my favorite from the franchise along with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. I was skeptical about the remake when they first spoke about it being in the works, but seeing the trailers and actually playing it entirely now? It's worth every damn cent you may consider spending.

For Resident Evil veterans:
The game offers old game mechanics and mixes new mechanics in just nicely. I know what you're thinking. You're skeptical about the ""Over-the-shoulder"" camera angle that was first introduced with Resident Evil 4. But I can tell you, it adds to the atmosphere, because you can't actually see things behind you for example. You may be focused on fighting off some enemies and another one just walks up behind you and scares you. The remake makes you remember places you're familiar with from the original Resident Evil 2, shows you new places and even changes the order you normally would see those places in. Is that bad? By no means. Is it just as good as the original? No. It's better. It looks better, plays better, has more fun mechanics and obviously, due to the lack of technological limitations the developers have nowadays, you can also expect some really surprising new stuff you would never expect in a Resident Evil game. Is the story different? Hmm...There's slight changes, but nothing drastic.

For the new players:
If you've never played one of the classic Resident Evil games (0,1,2,3,CVX etc.) then this is a good point to start in. Now, I suggest you play the remake of Resident Evil 1 first. It's on Steam as well and not that expensive. I can also wholeheartedly recommend that game. The remake is genuinely better than the PS1 original in every way possible. Now back to the RE2 remake. If you wanna buy this game without playing RE1 first, you can absolutely do that. RE2 is where the story really begins, where everything is explored in a deeper way and where actual character development happens. You may argue: ""Resident Evil 1 also had character development!"" - Yes, but not nearly as much as this. This is one of the first Resident Evil games that lets you feel some sort of pity or sympathy for the characters involved while the other Resident Evil games usually made you go ""Oh damn, that dude's dead."" or ""This guy's kinda cool."" or whatever. As a hardcore Resident Evil fan, I promise you that this game is worth every cent and if you haven't played a Resident Evil game before touching this, you'll wanna play the other ones afterwards to see how the story continues. Again, you'll understand everything even if you didn't play RE1, but you'll understand more easter eggs and references - which add to the experience, if you played Resident Evil 0 or Resident Evil 1.

Surprise surprise:
You can play as the rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy or as Claire Redfield, who's looking for her brother Chris (who many may remember from Resident Evil 1). Whichever you choose to play as first, once you finished the story - and this is important: Play the story of the other character too. The story is drastically different and answers all the questions that may come up during your first playthrough. I was actually surprised that it's not just a different character with different weapons. It feels like an entirely different game, even though 50% of the locations are just re-used. Trust me on this.

tl;dr:
Buy the game. You won't be disappointed.",Recommended," January 28, 2019"

Okay, slightly longer version? In 2018/2019, we aren't getting games this good, this polished, this packed with content, this faithfully created for fans, this fresh to survival horror, this fun as its own game for newcomers, and this replayable anymore.

Where most of the Triple-A market has grown stagnant with same-y Early Access retail releases littered with microtransactions and loot boxes, and survival horror being relegated to over-the-top co-op action leaving Indie developers to create new horror gems, this game is an honest-to-goodness breath of fresh air of quality that lovingly recreates the source material and one-ups it with modern standards crafted by years and years of experimental horror games.

The visuals are jaw-dropping. The art direction is evocative and bone-chilling. The new touches added to the game are pleasant surprises, especially some of the re-writes. The story is still cheesy as ever but it's fun and pulpy, much like the 90's when this game was made and is based. The locations are dense and full of detail, even full of little easter eggs if you pay close enough attention. The puzzles are great reprieves that tease the brain along with how your brain is crunched, bruised, massaged, and working at full capacity during combat, item management, and learning layouts of the levels. There's a palpable sense of risk-reward throughout the whole experience, where every step toward danger gets you a new weapon, new items, a safe room, a puzzle to take a breather, a clue to solving the greater mystery, an easter egg that pays homage to the fans and rest of the series.

I'm hesitant to go into any concrete detail because the experience is just that damn good and you need to experience it for yourself. If you love classic Resident Evil or new-school Resident Evil, you will love this game. If you love old-school survival horror, you will love this game. If you love bunches of (replayable) content, you'll love this game. If you love challenging games whether they be for speedruns or chasing the hardest of achievements, you'll love this game. If you love great, well-designed, well-structured, and well-paced games, you'll love Resident Evil 2 (Remake).

If Resident Evil 7 was an apology letter to fans, this one is a love letter.

Being someone who has played the original 1998 version when it first came out, I feel this remake has made some great changes while also having some flaws in not being able to live up to the superb quality production from the 1998's version. The 1998 version has scenarios A & B which are different but correlated to the plot. In the remake, the scenarios are not significantly different and a lot of things make no sense. For example, when William G-Type 2 kills Mr. X in Claire's scenario A, he still comes as a Boss as a transformed Tyrant in Leon's scenario B; in 1998's Leon's scenario B, Ada gets thrown by Mr. X and sustains a fatal injury on her waist that's a part of the real canon as shown in the epilogue of Resident Evil 3 where Ada looks at her scar on her waist caused from being thrown by Mr. X. But in this remake, whether scenario A or B, she falls to her ""so called"" death instead. I feel this remake could've been a whole lot better if they still kept a lot of the original elements while adding and enhancing the gameplay like they did with Resident Evil 1 remake. What made RE1 remake such a big success was they stayed true to the originality of the PS1 version while adding more elements to the remake version like Lisa Trevor, highly enhanced graphics, the mansion structure still being original while adding additional rooms and puzzles, etc. In this RE2 Remake, the plot line is messed up, it has no correlation to the original canon; some parts of the gameplay is unrealistic (for example, a zombie is outside the window trying to break in, but you can't shoot it through the window before it can break in; or a zombie is behind a door with a glass window and you can't shoot through the glass before it breaks in; etc). Overall, the environment and character designs are well done and highly detailed. Gameplay is overall great, just a few flaws as mentioned earlier. However, I hope Capcom remakes RE3: Nemesis nonetheless since the majority of the audience still have a general positive outlook with RE2 Remake. Don't mind me in my harsh critique :P",Recommended," January 27, 2019"

This is by far one of the best Remakes/Remasters I have ever witnessed.
I remember playing the Original back on the PlayStation 1 it scared the living ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of me. Now nearly a decade after I played it the Remastered is released and I feel like back then, getting scared of every corner I have to turn.

But now on some of the Gameplay parts:

The graphics look gorgous
The controls are smooth
The puzzles are challenging and interesting

And I must say it runs really smooth on my GTX 970 without FPS drops or lags.

Resident Evil 2 / Biohazard 2 (Remake 2019)

Release Date: January 25, 2019

Strengths:
-Survival Horror (Yes, many instances when fear and adrenaline rush will be experienced)
-Superb graphics (State of the art special effects and rendering)
-Great story and direction (Movie like story progression, good acting by voice artists)
-Realism (Realistic Ballistics, Characters, Models, Environment)
-Clearly one of the most improved RE games till date in terms of graphics, gameplay and composition.


Limitations:
-No dodging ability in characters to dodge attacks (which is a big let down)
-High violence (Blood, Gore, Intense Violence. Not suitable for all players)
-Acceptable but not long enough playtime (10-20 hours of main campaign at average play speed)
-Limited enemy types and guns (enemies in main campaign are zombies, lickers, tyrant, sewer monsters, plant-zombies, zombie-dogs and that's it!)
-Non-Destructible Environment (Even the lamps don't go off if you shoot them! Destructible environment like in Rainbow 6 Seige should have been added that would make the game perfect.)
-No Multiplayer Mode


Conclusion:

Capcom's remake of its 1998 hit Resident Evil-2 is back in 2019 with latest graphics and recreation of one of the legendary survival horror games of all time. Capcom has taken a right turn in trying to improve what made resident evil games popular in the first place rather than becoming something entirely new. Resident Evil-7 was a fairly successful experiment but what comes with Resident Evil-2 Remake is exactly what most of the fans of the series want and the reason it is an immediate hit. I am glad to say that they have done the best possible job in remaking the original title and preserving the scenes, environment and also adding new dimensions so that the player has something new to experience too. The game is built on the new RE game engine which is superbly realistic and combat is awesome. The game has inherited all great and unique features from other RE games like defensive items like knives, grenades from RE-1 Remake, gunpowder combinations from RE-3 to create different type of ammo, with some new options like bolting the windows shut with wooden boards (like in Rainbow 6 Siege) etc. and removed the unnecessary and obsolete features like ink ribbon to save the game (well in hardcore mode it is still there but for players who want an easier game mode to play, the saves are infinite and don't require ink ribbon items). The only let down is that the game doesn't include the attack dodging ability of the characters as present in many new RE games. Including this feature would've made the game almost perfect. Anyway the gameplay is very good to say the least. The main story is same to the original and you can play as Leon or Claire as in the original game. However, there are a few side stories as well, additional game content that increases the overall play time and make the original story, a bit more detailed and content rich. It's not as long as RE-4 but has a decent play time of 10-20 hours on average and even more if you intend to play it slow or choose the challenging hardcore mode. The best part of the gameplay that I found is the chasing down by the Tyrant. Tyrant (for newbies) is an unstoppable juggernaut of the Umbrella Corporation that is unleashed at the Police Station Site to hunt down any survivors (including the protagonists). He can't be killed but can be slowed down by firing. He will continue to chase you and since the ammo is limited (in normal game modes) you have to make a run for it in order to survive. He reminds me of 'Nemesis' from RE-3 although Nemesis is more deadlier and faster. Maybe we'll see him in RE-3 remake which is likely to be developed by Capcom. The game has good replayability due to new unlockable costumes and items, alternate endings, different game modes etc. So, overall, RE-2 Remake is a genuine RE experience and probably one of the best RE games till date in terms of action, gameplay, survival horror and story. Although strictly speaking, I feel, it is overpriced if weighted with the amount of game content and play time given, but it's definitely a good game in all aspects that are included.

Capcom has pretty much set the new standard for Remakes of old games.

Other devs like Square-Enix need to see what Capcom did and either match/top this level of quality for games like FF:VII Remake, etc.

QoL changes, pacing, and much more were so well executed with REMake 2.

I was more terrified playing this game than I was with Resident Evil 7 (which is a first person game, mind you).

Not to mention too. I only completed Part 1 of Leon's story and I have a total playtime of 10 hours right now. I still have to do both of Claire's Parts and also Leon's Part 2.

So if you're casually playing this game and actually exploring the environments (which you should be). You can be looking at about 30 - 40 hours of total playtime. Not to mention the extra game modes that Capcom announced recently too.

Please support this game if you can. Capcom needs to see that with quality like this. People will buy their games. (Top 10 most played games on Steam as we speak) I just wished that this level of quality was in their fighting games as well.",Recommended," January 27, 2019"

Top quality horror & action. I was scared to leave the saferoom on my first playthrough :D

The only thing I didn't like was how indifferent the two campaigns were apart from a few small places, cutscenes and guns. It almost felt like playing the campaign again with a different character model. I expected more variety between them.",Recommended," November 27, 2019"

First of all, i am a avid RE fan and played every game, but none has made me play countless hours such as this one.

I am of the the few who actually believes that there is not a single bad main line Resident Evil game, they are all different and do well being what they were designed to do mechanically - Resident Evil 6 is my favorite action game, Resident Evil 1 is my favorite puzzel game - and this Resident Evil 2 2019 or REmake 2 as I like to call it, is my favorite horror game since Alien Isolation.

Combat is fun and is fairly easy to get use to - espcially if if you are familar with the controls of RE4-5. The graphics are great and do an amazing job are placing you into the world. As of my writing this however - there is a known bug that seems to impact Nvidia cards related to the games lighting - however some settings tweaking fix's the problem and hopefully Nvidia release drivers for this game. The game runs well even on my Geforce 940MX card from god knows when.

Story is mostly unchanged - great - no plot holes that I can think of.

Update: End of the Year... still the GOTY for me!

Amazing game and complete remake of an old classic RE game. Even if you have never played any Resident Evil game before this would be a great place to start since everything is self contained in this game. The visuals are easily the best of any game that has come out so far with it's photo realistic environments and presentation to really sell you on the location and story the game is taking place in. I highly recommend picking up this game for anyone interested in classic Survival Horror.",Recommended," January 27, 2019"

The ""Did not"" Review

Pros
- Not a lame remaster
- No lootbox
- Did not f*** up the release
- No ""sorry fans"" letter from Devs
- No day 1 patch needed
- Not an early access game
- Not a battle royale game
- Not a broken game
- No day 1 DLC

Can't think of a single f*** up which is a very rare for triple-A studios nowadays.

I liked the game on my first playthough. Then? Then it made me angry.
If I'm honest, I do actually recommend the game, but let me explain my problem here. I enjoyed the gameplay, I think it's fun and entertaining. The environment is fine, the game looks nice at most times. The plot is a bit messy, and it's rather short. The only reason it took me a bit long is because I like exploring and I took my time to check every room of each map to find everything I could. Otherwise, it would have been over in like 5 hours. The puzzles are fun and I also liked the action. There aren't many types of enemies so I believe it can be a bit boring for some people. The zombies are bullet sponges, but I still had enough bullets on ""normal"" mode to kill almost every enemy so I had no problem with that. (I know, I didn't have to kill everything, but I wanted to.) Mr. X didn't bother me either. He makes the game harder, but I still had half the police station to explore when he arrived, and I explored it anyway. I don't think it's hard to get away from him, because he's slow and there are plenty of safe rooms where I could hide. I don't think he's as bad or hard to beat as I saw some people think. The characters are a bit shallow and somewhat boring. The voice acting is meh, it's nothing special. I bought this game for Leon and I'm a little bit disappointed by how... dull was he portrayed here. Other than that, the chemistry between characters didn't really work well for me, I don't think it was well made. But that's not what bothers me, because I still had plenty of fun playing it.
So. Why did I end up being angry at this game? When you start it, you can choose between the 2 main characters, Leon and Claire. This determines how your routes will play out: the chara you picked first has route A and the other one has route B. In my case, it was Leon route A. This means I solved every puzzle, killed almost all enemies, collected everything, opened all doors/gates and saved the day with Leon. Then, there was no ending. My son Leon defeated the big bad and then suddenly: credits. Then the game told me that I can now play Claire route B and THEN I can see the true ending. Okay, I said. The game and plot let me believe that Claire was minding her own business in the meanwhile and now I can see what was she doing. So I started Claire B. The game cut the full beginning out and started at a different point... and I noticed quickly: everything was back at the start. Everything was locked, every enemy was there again, every puzzle was unsolved. Even the jump scares were the same. Even though I think in my case Claire B plot was supposed to support and add more to Leon A plot, that's not what it did. It doesn't matter who you choose at the beginning and it doesn't matter what you did in route A: you have to repeat EVERYTHING in route B that you just finished doing in route A. Every single thing, puzzles, enemies... You have to do it all over again. I don't care that they have at least different weapons and different lines to scream when they are frustrated. It makes zero sense, because it creates a complete mess of which chara did what: because they do the exact same thing. Other than that, they don't even meet, only at the start and the end, they don't communicate or see each other, when they are supposed to be in the same building at the same time. It messes up the timeline and I simply don't understand who thought it was a good idea to force the player to repeat the game TWICE for the true ending. There are some small differences: you get about 20 minutes to play with yet another character in both routes and have about 3 different cutscenes. Other than that, both Leon and Claire have their own big bad to defeat. Then, whoever had route B can defeat the TRUE big bad in the TRUE ending. Everything else is the same. I truly hate everything about this idea. Now, I have not played the original RE2 yet, so I don't know how this worked there, and it also means that I do not have nostalgia to say it is perfect and flawless, because it is true to the original and whatnot. I think this is ridiculous and tedious. I simply don't see why couldn't they write different plot or make different puzzles or at least create new maps (except a very small one) for route B. The game introducing 2 different characters with different routes makes you think you can finish the game in many ways, but no. The choice is an illusion.
I didn't really want to give this game a negative review... It's not like I didn't enjoy the game or don't think it's good. It is good, it is fun (maybe too short for the full price) and I do recommend to play route A with whoever you like... But be prepared for this nonsense. I was about to give it a positive review, but when I realized that I am now forced to complete the same damned story again for the true ending which is basically just 10 minutes plus, I simply decided to rage quit route B. I will mostly likely finish it anyway, but this completely ruined it for me. I can't give a positive review, because creating a game this way is simply lazy, stupid and unimaginative.
Update: Finished route B (a lot quicker since I already knew where to go and what to do...). My opinion didn't change. There were small differences, but it's basically the same plot twice and this creates serious problems with the timeline. It's simply a mess like this.",Not Recommended, April 15

In the days of AAA developers steering away from single player games, in favor of online multiplayer Destiny clones, one developer listened to their fans and delivered a refreshing take on the classic Playstation game, Resident Evil 2, only 24 months after delivering a refreshing sequel (Resident Evil VII) to a close to dead franchise.

Resident Evil franchise was all but dead. Resident Evil 5
wasn‚Äôt really a Resident Evil game (More action than Survival horror). Resident Evil 6
was worse. Resident Evil Revelations 2 was a step in the right direction, but Capcom is starting to really shine and get some momentum with their releases in terms of quality, performance and surprises.

This is the scariest game I‚Äôve ever played period. And the game isn‚Äôt filled with dozens of jump scares like Outlast. Resident Evil 2 REmake is legitimately filled with dread, that can probably single handedly be pointed to the re-arrival of Mr X., who stalks you throughout the game, wherever you go. It‚Äôs brilliant and it keeps you guessing throughout your playthroughs with Leon and Claire.

Players who have experienced the 1998 original, will be happy to know that although Point A and Point Z might be similar, playing through the game points B, C, D, E, F, G........W, X, Y, are completely different. The puzzles are different. The interaction with NPCs are different. Ada Wong and Sheri are handled differently. And there‚Äôs just enough surprises to keep the pacing good and the fear great.

Hardcore mode was amazing, the atmosphere was very claustrophobic and felt like I rarely had the amount of room needed to dodge enemies-a very good feel in a survival horror game. I never had enough health and was one foot in the grave all the way up to the ending. The amount of ammo given felt a little off like there were too many bullets in the game, but maybe I was just playing a little too conservatively?. The enemies were definitely a challenge.

I do not ever write reviews for games, but for this one I feel obligated to due to the amount of fun I've had with it. As a fan of survival horror games it definitely brought me fear, panic, and tension but after making it past the obstacle (looking at you Mr. X) it was easy to laugh at myself. Not only is it a game that respects the horror genre but simply a game that feels rewarding when you properly conserve certain items/ammo and I could easily visualize myself getting better in this aspect and at the game in general. Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone even considering getting it as I've already had loads of fun with it in the short time it has been out.",Recommended," January 30, 2019"

It took me forever to get around to playing this, but hype for RE3 forced me to drop the long RPG I was in the middle of and finally install this. I was a fan of the original, though I only completed one playthrough back then, as Leon. This time around, I chose Claire and then Leon for my 2nd run. The game is extremely addictive and unnerving as hell, much more so than the original RE2. It's survival horror at its finest, forcing you to think about conserving ammo and managing inventory space. The weapons for each character are varied, despite some of them being clear analogues between the two. I found them all extremely satisfying to use, especially the shotgun I picked up fairly early in Leon's run, which makes mincemeat out of any zombie unlucky enough to poke its head into your sights. If I had to choose one thing about this game as the main highlight, it would be its sound design. With a pair of surround headphones, all of the eerie noises around you work in concert with the amazing and creepy OST to create an unsettling and immersive atmosphere. Overall, this game's going down as one of the all-time greats.",Recommended," December 23, 2019"

I didn't play the original Resident evil 2, but im sure as hell it's good. I play the RE 4, 6, and 7, and for me this game is the best. its quite easy, if you like horror game especially Zombie game, you should buy this game, if you followed the Resident evil franchise, you must buy this game, if you haven't play Resident evil game you can start from this game because this game explain the origin of G Virus. And i have 3 main reason why i recommend this game

1. the gameplay, story and graphics are astonishing
only one word ""MAGNIFICENT""
2. it's not like other boring zombie game
zombie here are not many but every zombie is count, the zombie is hard to kill and sometimes the zombie is not 'Really' Dead

3. it's REPLAYABILITY
you can play it again and again to get the full big story and you also can use other character

Play on Hardcore mode, it isn't tedious and it's really ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing fun.

RE2MAKE is the most true and honest survival horror you'll ever play. Before it, the series was never scary (besides original RE1 dog window...), and classic RE titles (before RE4) gave you too much ammo and enough health items all to get through. This made saving the world from giant men with claws as easy as riding a bike.

Puzzles are as basic as ever but the game rewards planning and decision making in its action (thanks to resources being more scarce than ever before). You will be constantly deciding whenever it's worth expending more ammo to completely dispose of a zombie over destroying their kneecap(s) to give the room a case of hazardous zombie floor to sustain more ammo. This is all greatly aided by the the amazing visuals coupled with top-notch sound design (ambience that even Dead Space cannot compare with) that will keep your hair on edge constantly.

I'm very glad people who somehow missed the original's Scenario B are seeing Mr. X for the first time (who in this game is much, much greater than Nemesis ever was). He's the true star of the re-imagining.
Returning monsters are as great as ever and the Ivies had a dramatic change, now acting like Regenerators from RE4.

RE2MAKE is very faithful, some cutscenes were done better in RE2, but RE2MAKE easily gives RE1MAKE a run for its money.
I would even go so far to say it is on par with RE4 for completely different reasons. If you feel RE4 is the best third person shooter game of all time, I am certain RE2MAKE will be the best survival horror you'll ever play, if not the best horror game.

If you like Dead Space 1/2, Resident Evil 4 and the classic Resident Evil videogames, get it.",Recommended," January 29, 2019"

This game is an example of how to make remakes.
I played the original in the early 2000s, but the remake - perfectly conveyed the very atmosphere of horror, while completely transforming.
The developers carefully handled the setting of the police station filled with the walking dead.
The zombies themselves (as well as the characters) are perfectly drawn (both externally and in the animation).
The dead are perhaps the best in the series; they are recreated in small details, really cause disgust and fear.
And even a couple in a dark corridor can create problems (even though the camera is behind us, as in RE4).
Bosses also do not give relax. There are not many characters, but their models also look great, and they are all also memorable.
Not to say that the plot is original, but the police station is interesting to explore (riddles, secrets, everything is in place).
And by the second half of the game, the locations, although they are becoming more linear, but it is still interesting to explore them.
It‚Äôs a pity, of course, that the companies for Leon and Claire are not much different (mostly in arms), and they have only a few different forks, but they pass pretty quickly, so they don‚Äôt have time to get bored.
The game will definitely appeal to those who again want to plunge into the atmosphere of the filled with zombies Raccoon City, and especially those who once missed Resident Evil 2.",Recommended," November 29, 2019"

Probably the best Resident Evil I have ever played. Game looks and plays fantastic. The level design and combat are on point as well. I also reccomend playing through both stories to get the full experience out of it.

anyway enough rambling how is the game.. the graphics are outstanding. the controls are fluid as ever. game runs smooth as hell. not really too much else to say. still feels like a love letter to the original but modernized enough to feel like it belongs in the current year. il add to this the further i get but right now i 100% recommend this to anyone that enjoys the old style of survival horror. or even modern horror but with a classic twist.",Recommended," January 27, 2019"

Today's Review: Resident Evil 2 (Remake)

Overview and general thoughts:
This game strikes a balance between faithful to the original and modern, it holds its roots as a real survival horror game but introduces real action mechanics, let's say its what Resident Evil 6 should have been.
After the ""reboot"" for the series Resident Evil 7 was, not so much of a reboot but more a new setting for the series, away from the known and loved protagonists Leon, Chris, Jill, etc. RE7 was fresh air from an entirely new perspective, a new setting and new protagonist, for as good as RE might be, it always live as what it was, one of the first Survival Horror games and RE2 Remake takes some elements from its 1998 brother and convines it with the more recent RE4 over the shoulder perspective, while keeping all the important aspects of the original such as the earie police station, the characters that intercross paths with the main protagonists: Leon and Claire, and the antogonists such as William Birkin and Mr. X, but this new found balance its even here more in the RE4 side of things as Leon looks more like the previously mentioned as it was back in the former. Almost everything makes a come back in this game (except the giant spiders) and some areas have been expanded from the original 2 discs of 700mb that later was ported to other consoles like the N64. The engrosing atmosphere and the delightful sounds and soundtrack, mixed with the relentless persuer and all the classic enemies from old resident evil games are here, many many easter eggs across the entire game, amazing boss fights and characters that have deeper backstory alongside with free dlc like Ghost Survivors alongside with all dlc that returns like The 4th Survivor and Tofu, 2 scenarios and a lot of replayability if you choose not to buy the 5 dollars dlc that unlocks everything, still is a choice you can make. This game was one of my first PS1 games as a kid and a choice i made over Crash Bandicoot 3, also my first ever survival horror game, that introduced me to the world of jump scares and smart inventory management, followed by RE1 and Silent Hill, this is a faithtful recreation and another great entry for the series that hopefully one day will lead me to review Resident Evil Nemesis Remake. I will be missing some key notes here but my advice is: buy it, this is a great game that was great 20 years ago and Capcom reinvented as soon as they announce it was being made, i played through it several times and i have no plans to stop, this review will be followed by an in depth more detailed one in the future.

Score: 98/100

After finishing Leon A, this is a great return to form by Capcom with Resident Evil. Goes to show they could always pull off survival horror again with a third person perspective.

*NOTE*
Zombies take a lot of bullets to kill. You can go through the whole game without killing anyone but the bosses. The point of the game is to survive. Shoot zombies in the knee and immobilise them. The game is not expecting you to always go for the kill. You will run out resources for doing so and will brick your own save if you attempt to. Play smart!",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

Resident Evil 2: Remake manages to recreate what made the Original Resident Evil 2 on the PlayStation special, making this one a special and fresh experience as well. It recreates the game while adding new elements to it to modernize the gameplay a bit, and it also makes some nice story changes which are surprisingly fitting to the game.


Thats it for the short version. How about we go a little in-depth for anyone with some spare time to read?


This is a Survival Horror game. You cannot go guns blazing and shoot everything you see. Ammo is extremely limited. Same goes for healing items. During a lot of combat moments, you'll have to run away from enemies rather than engage head on. Your character's movement is slow intentionally. You may hate that, but this helps to keep the game balanced and intense at times, instead of turning it into a running simulator, with no need to engage in combat at all.
Aiming also feels a bit stiff and slow. This also helps to balance things out. You are playing as a rookie after all...

The base of the story remains the same from the original game. However, the way this story unfolds has been tweaked a bit. And thats not a bad thing. This is better than copy pasting 100% of the story into the Remake, as veterans who played the Original game, would know exactly what happens at all times. Changing some aspects makes us experience a sorta fresh experience while also having that ""familiar"" feeling as well.

Folks who played the original Resident Evil games on the Play Station, they are going to feel right at home. The game is fairly difficult, but its possible to get a bit unfair at some rare moments depending on your inventory management.
But if you're new to the Resident Evil games or, god forbid, you only played the games released after Resident Evil 5, you might have some trouble with the difficulty. Zombies don't die by one headshot here...or two...or three...or four! You can also get lost or stuck if you're reckless with your navigation. Don't expect a lot of hand holding.

This is where it goes a bit downhill. This is all my opinion, mind you! I don't speak for other folks as everyone has different preferences. Remake's Soundtrack just feels ""Odd"". It has a Resident Evil 7 vibe to it, which I am not a fan of. Most of the time its just too quiet or simply absent. And when I first heard the ""Escape From Laboratory"" theme of the Remake, I just couldn't enjoy it.
The Original PS1 Soundtrack is available for Deluxe Owners and can be bought as seperate DLC as well. It has been added in the game and it works flawlessly. Its fitting, enjoyable and gives you a great sense of Nostalgia. I definitely enjoyed this game more with the Original PS1 OST enabled.

They are great. They are not 2019 cutting edge technology but they still look magnificant when you crank up those Visual Settings. Character models and animations are gorgeously detailed and the facial expressions are insanely good. Shooting zombies and seeing chunks fly outta their face is just satisfying. Exploding stuff with the Grenade Launcher or other explosives looks beautiful as well.

Its done pretty well. I played the game on release day, and it managed to run at a constant 60+ FPS. No crashes so far as well. Optimization is done pretty well on all areas.

At the time of writing this review, I managed to beat only one Scenario, Leon A. It lasted a total of 8 hours. The game features 4 Scenarios plus 2 bonus unlockable minigames. So its safe to say, you get at least 30 hours of playtime. New Scenarios require you visiting most of the areas previously explored in the previous Scenario, albeit with different item placements and sometimes new enemy placements as well. This ain't exactly a bad thing unless you really hate ""replaying"" the same levels.


Capcom finally decided to make a game about what Resident Evil originally was. A Survival Horror Experience. And they absolutely nailed this one. Everything about this game feels damn fine. Its the Remake that the fans always deserved after all this wait. Its a must have for every Old School Resident Evil fan!

Atmosphere is amazing as well the dark hallways and 3rd person view that was never in the ps1 version just clicks so well in this remake

This game can be a hit or miss for people, but this game was definitely a hit for me.
This remake has kept the game true to its original while bringing a more modern look and mechanics to allow players to experience the ultimate survival horror gameplay. This isn't your average walk in the park where you have an abundance of ammo to shoot every zombie. Instead, you are given a limited amount, forcing you to make decisions in whether to kill, joke, or stagger the enemies. It's very thrilling and makes your heart pump when put in desperate situations. Game is too easy? Play on hardcore and experience how it's meant to be played and challenge yourself to a speedrun as well. All notes have important information that pertain to the story or puzzles, so make sure not to disregard all notes.

Definitely pick up this game if you can on sale or not. There is plenty of replayability and other modes besides the storyline.",Recommended," July 4, 2019"

Coming from a person that long stopped playing single player story driven video games because the sheer amount of low quality first person shooters we've been getting bombarded with from the last 15 years.

RESIDENT EVIL 2 Remake is the TRUE AAA quality. So polished... oh my god!

Refreshing to play such iconic brutal poetry that was Resident Evil franchise in brand new gorgeous graphics and point of view. They nailed it. I have no words to describe.

1 hour of this is 10x more rewarding and enjoyable than 1 hour of our current average open world game.

I don't feel that has been only 5 hours of my game time in this. So packed with detail. I feel like out of the limbo from this past decade.

A true SURVIVAL experience.

CAPCOM What the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Ace quality, Ace execution.

DLC content and termination of development engagement are the bad sides of this title. It feels pure, maybe too pure as it deserved some content drops here and there from time to time. It is how games used to be, right? Development>Release>Done. There is a few extra content to make up for it.

I thoroughly recommend this game at maximum price offer (all content).

It is still a horror game and will make your blood pressure rise. Beware.

ARCANE RAISE - CURATOR PAGE

Intro:
The 2019 remake of Resident Evil 2 is without a doubt one of the greatest games of this generation, perhaps even of all time. It manages to capture the atmosphere and suspense of the original release perfectly and is a true return to the Survival-Horror roots of this franchise. It is a masterfully crafted masterpiece that is as close as it gets to a perfect game. The only negative things I can ever say about this game are nitpicking and small issues that might not even bother other people that much.

So let me start with those; first of all, the absolute biggest problem I had with the game was a somewhat game-breaking bug near the end of my campaign as Leon where the screen would fade to black thus halting game progress. Thankfully, there are two ways to get around this bug which I will mention at the end of this review (for people who also encountered this glitch).

Another issue that sticks out like a sore thumb is how this iteration of ""Adaptive Difficulty"" is handled. This is by far the poorest implementation of this feature in any Resident Evil title so far. It is extremely jarring and makes the game incredibly inconsistent overall. For those that do not know, apart from the 3 starting Difficulty Options (Assisted, Normal & Hardcore), the game further adjusts its difficulty, behind the scenes, to match the player's skill level. For example, if you kill a lot of enemies without taking any damage, the game will then increase the health of the remaining enemies as well as the damage the player takes from them. As a result, zombies may suddenly go from dying to 3 headshots to facetanking 15 bullets like a brick wall! It is even worse with boss battles that start off as bullet sponges who then eventually die to a few clips after you get killed a couple of times and restart.

And the third issue is not really a problem with the game itself, rather how greedy its publisher is (with Deluxe Edition and costume DLCs). CAPCOM has certainly taken the right step with this franchise and Resident Evil is going in the right direction, but this greedy DLC scheme is nothing short of a blatant cash grab. The costumes are incredibly overpriced when they used to be free in-game unlockables in the classic titles. Also, the original/classic soundtrack is locked behind a paywall as well.

Last but not least, it's not really a big deal but the DirectX12 rendering mode in this game is utterly broken and runs like absolute crap so you might want to stick to DX11 until/unless this is fixed.

Apart from all that, this game is almost perfect and would have been a solid 10/10 without the issues mentioned above.


- High replay value
- Excellent voice acting
- Decent weapon and item variety
- Surprisingly high attention to detail
- Free rogue-like DLC: Ghost Survivors
- Lots of content to explore and unlock
- Very detailed character and model design
- In-depth Zombie dismemberment system
- Highly addictive and enjoyable Gameplay
- Faithful re-imagining of the original game
- Post-game content: 4th Survivor and Second Runs
- Amazing graphics; the best looking visuals to date
- Great story with decent pacing and well-written dialog
- Photorealistic environment and natural material design
- Top quality sound effects and perfect 3D binaural audio
- True survival-horror with an excellent resource-management system
- Decent crafting system for combining herbs, crafting ammo and upgrading weapons


- integration
- Extremely challenging and difficult
- Incredibly resilient enemies; zombies can survive half a dozen headshots


- Too short overall
- Lackluster boss battles
- Overpriced DLC costumes
- A game-breaking visual glitch[‚úù]
- Blue herbs are still pretty useless
- Deluxe Edition is a bad value for money
- Utterly broken and unoptimized DirectX12 mode
- Adaptive difficulty is very noticeable and detracts from the experience

[‚úù] I've only encountered one game-breaking bug during two of the cutscenes near the end of the game (as Leon) where the screen would turn completely black during the movie (with the audio still playing) then turn white after it's over (with the game still going on), requiring a restart. The only way to get around it in-game is to quickly skip the cutscenes (one involving Ada, and another involving Annette) before the screen turns to black. A workaround is to go to the installation folder, edit ""re2_config.ini"" then set ""UseVendorExtention="" to ""Disable"". This would drastically decrease performance (FPS) but will allow those cutscenes to play out normally.

9.25/10 - Masterpiece
RE2 Remake is one of the greatest games of all time and even manages to beat the original RE2 in terms of quality, quite easily. A true survival-horror experience with breathtaking graphics and mind-blowing sound. It is everything a Resident Evil fan could possibly want out of this franchise. Everyone needs to play this true masterpiece, strongly recommended and totally worth the full price.",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

5 minutes to go before the whole umbrella facility goes BOOM! I tightly grasp my controller while sweat pours down my arms and head. ""I can do this!"" I tell myself. It's about my 20th retry on Hardcore mode on leon A and I've already saved 3 times, my last save having been at the entrance of the Labs. To have to go through all the plants, lickers, Mr.X, and G3 just to get to super Tyrant was beginning to become exhausting. I had reloaded the save so much, I memorized sections of the game. The clock kept ticking away as I was down to my last First-Aid spray when all of a sudden, that beautiful girl they call Ada threw me down a rocket launcher. I waited for the opportunity to seize the launcher as Super X lunged at me. With a loud yelp, I sent 2 rockets at super X's face for a satisfying conclusion to my hardcore S+ rank accomplishment.
From the moment I booted up this game, I could not put the controller down. Although I never played Resident Evil 2: OG 98 I would watch my stepbrother play it when I was little. Resident Evil 4 was not only my first Resident Evil game but my favorite one! I've played 5 and 6 as well but nothing will ever beat 4, well, until this game came out that is... I wouldn't necessarily say it beats 4 but dam does it come close. Not having played the original RE2, this game made me more of a fan and got me back into RE. Here are my Pros and Cons:

Pros:
Great story
Original soundtrack swap=AMAZING(Although the remake is good too).
Mr.X
Exploring
HUNK!!!!!!!!!

Cons:
Some inconsistencies involving story
Repeated grabs

I just got S+rank on Leon A minutes before writing this review. The hardcore mode WILL KICK YOUR BUTT if your not careful on how you conserve items. But please consider getting S+ rank, as killing Mr.X with a rocket at the end brings sooooooo much satisfaction. Please give this game a go.",Recommended," April 4, 2019"

Resident Evil 2 is a really damn solid reimagining of the 1998 classic.

Absolutely love this game! Somehow I've avoided spoilers since the game came out so this was a fresh experience playing RE2.

Story was fan-fuccing-tastic, I just wish it was helluva lot longer. My 1st playthrough was just above 5h and the 2nd was about 3h.
Gameplay had no problems and was in general good. It reminded me of RE7, that's the only other RE game I've played.

A welcome and much needed entry to the survival horror genre. Veterans and new comers to the Resident Evil series can all find something to love about this game, really taking it back to the roots.
That said, the controls were clearly optimized for a game pad rather than M+K, so it might be a bit awkward in some aspects. For a game with emphasis on avoiding conflict with zombies, I wish their grab distance was nerfed, but it's still managable. The game isn't perfect but it's a step in the right direction for the genre and the series, which I support.

The amount of control you have with the graphics is insane. Total Biscuit would be proud.

There are far too many frustrating mechanics for me to enjoy this game. Being unable to clear out a room of zombies is my biggest annoyance. It just isn‚Äôt worth the ammo since it is so scarce. Shooting out their legs works but when you bait a zombie to give chase then have another zombie gnaws at your legs that you de-legged earlier makes you wish you just wasted the ammo and killed it in the first place.

Wish there was a metal knife instead of all these plastic ones I keep finding.

The hulk has the best hearing I have ever seen. It will hear you from the opposite side of the map and bee line a path directly to you but then doesn‚Äôt hear you when you drop a bell down the bell tower.

The machine gun is the most useless gun in the game. A full clip won‚Äôt even drop a single zombie. After sinking 127 bullets into the head of a zombie it still didn‚Äôt explode.

There is a good game in here but it is buried beneath layers and layers of frustrating design choices.",Not Recommended," January 27, 2019"

very stressful, even if like me you aren't easily spooked you still should find yourself constantly in total tension as you approach dangerous situations with few supplies. it also has a classic story and actually tons of content (which i think i'm only about 1/4 of the way through) faithful yet different and maybe the best survival horror game ever made putting (imo) the original version miles in the past. 7 was a good game and a step in the right direction, using the same engine and expanding on a lot of ideas its practically perfect, regardless of if you enjoyed 7 it was a good step forward despite being a way off perfect and i would imagine most peoples complaints about 7's gameplay are addressed and improved here.

also seemingly very well optimised for pc, no crashes so far and a cavalcade of options and ran smoothly since day 1. the settings menu seems to overestimate your computer (or it did mine) but turning of max shadows to high shadows (which is an unnoticable difference) almost halfs the memory usage so look out for that setting. also seems to run better on fullscreen than borderless which is a shame. works with changing input, doesn't die on alt tab either.",Recommended," January 29, 2019"
633,H2O,"
Finished my first campaign as Leon and thoroughly enjoyed it and think that's enough to recommend. I never played the original, and have only ever played 4+5, and have to say it's pretty much up there with 4.

If there's any negatives, it's probably that the combat could've been better with some enemies, and I feel like the randomized nature of how many bullets it takes to kill more or less sways you from ever engaging in combat unless it's completely necessary. Which may be to the games aesthetic, but there's no denying that killing zombies is satisfying in this.

Mr X is also a missed oppurtunity. It becomes apparent early on that engaging him is a waste of time. The encounters are more or less easy to avoid. The fact you can pause your game to constantly view your map means you will never fail to keep going unless you get cornered. And to that degree, these encounters are kind of a waste. It just adds a little frustration within the police station rather than creating anything interesting.

But overall, this game is fun. And I'm already ready for the next playthrough.",Recommended," January 26, 2019"
634,B. Silva,"
For me this is a very overrated game. I liked Resi 2 back in the day, but things have moved on in the last 20 years, whilst the design of this remake hasn't (other than the controls no longer being awful)

Games being challenging is one thing, but putting a game on hardcore mode and having it be utterly ridiculous is another. It's very stingy with giving you ammo, and is bizarrely inconsistent about how many head shots an enemy takes to put down. Sometimes it will take one handgun bullet, and other times the same enemy takes ten (not exaggerating there)

Those ten bullets will most of the time be all that you have, and there'll still be more enemies to face. So you'll end up running away much, much, more than ever shooting anything.

This is further compounded by making you face bosses where there is the bare minimum of health and ammo given for the task (if at all) and then it instantly makes you do another action / boss sequence without giving you any more.

I'm at the end of the game, and it seems to think I spent the last 10+ hours hoarding bullets because I HAVE PSYCHIC POWERS, AND KNOW IN ADVANCE THAT THERE'LL BE A BOSS FIGHT AT THE END THAT GIVES NO AMMO WHATSOEVER. Yet the game has also made evading enemies tricky enough that I had no choice but to shoot them, so, uh, haven't got that ammo it seems to think I have.

As an example: a boss that you face upon a relatively small platform has a charge attack that kills you instantly, and is UNAVOIDABLE. The game tips helpfully tell you to ""hit it with everything you've got when this happens"", and I'd love to do that, except...well, ""everything I've got"" adds up to the sum of....*fudge* all and the game isn't going to lift a finger to help.

Plus: its normal attack lunges faster than you move, so you're constantly wanting to (sluggishly) get out of range. While doing this it can quickly break out the HOMING UNAVOIDABLE INSTA KILL ATTACK, and you die trying to turn and shoot it in this extremely short window of time......so, so, sooooooo much fun. Every single boss in the game is tedious like this, and having faced four so far not a single one presented an interesting or enjoyable challenge.

For an action game it's riddled with moments where the clunky controls and miserly level design (no ammo, no space to really move) make the action really, really bad. You can't dodge attacks, and once hit you start limping which makes further evasion very tricky. You have no melee attacks without a knife equipped, or any offensive capabilities at all when out of ammo.

Clubbing away zombies with the butt of your empty gun? nah, chief - never heard of it.

Knock a zombie to the floor, and then stomp on it's head while it's prone....er, sorry chief! Never heard of it (despite it being a design idea from a 2008 game - Dead Space)

Shoot a zombie in half with your shotgun to slow them down? er....chief, have you had a blow to the head? cos that there is crazy talk (despite it being from 1998....and, er, is from the original Resi 2.....)

Shoot a leg off, or an arm, or indeed any body part at all, to give yourself an advantage.....er....nah, chief etc etc etc

Bunch of zombies standing by a fire extinguisher, and you get the clever idea to shoot it in the hope that it explodes, taking them all out? er....congrats - you just wasted a valuable bullet! Compressed gas containers don't explode in this universe (well, unless they're in the jaws of a giant alligator and you want to end with some ""big spectacle"" to an otherwise crappy set piece)

I guess making your game very pretty excuses it having even lesser action than the twenty year old original! It feels super backwards compared to the likes of Dead Space, which quite nicely removed a lot of the tedium and awkwardness from the Resi formula without sacrificing the exploration and survival aspect. The Evil Within is also much better at being survival horror whilst giving you a much more flexible character, proper stealth and enjoyable combat.

Action set pieces are non existent (there's not even the faintest whiff of Resi 4 to be had here), the puzzles are stupid, and stealth is a concept it claims to have but in practice it's terrible. There's blind enemies who hunt by sound, so you walk by totally silently and they still move into your path and just sit there leaving you stuck.

You walk forwards - they sense you and you die. You walk back - they sense you and you die. You stand still - they creep forward and you die.....

You expected their AI to eventually move away so that you could proceed? Ha! Ha! You poor deluded fool..... Gotta go back to your last save point, and pray that on the next attempt they have a brain fart and let you pass quickly enough. Is that good game design? I don't think that it is.

Even if the difficulty wasn't ridiculous this would still have enough things that, despite enjoying it up to a point, I'd still stay it was pretty average game play wise. And that nostalgia, or sexy graphics, are covering over a fairly mediocre and outdated experience. 18 hours into the game, and stuck at an impossible bit, I didn't enjoy it enough that I'm going to restart it all on a lesser difficulty!

If I played it on normal to begin with then this would probably be a moderately unenthusiastic positive review. There's enough deficiencies here in the game play mechanics, and in it's rather stunted ambition, that I wouldn't rate it that highly regardless of the excruciatingly badly judged challenge. Game play design that's barely moved on from 1998 doesn't cut the mustard for me in 2019.

When you scrape past an encounter it's tense, and it is this thing called being FUN. But more often than not it immediately descends into being a tedious chore after those enjoyable moments, as the gratification of ACTUALLY SHOOTING SOMETHING inevitably makes the next heavily scripted, and unbelievably stingy, section a pain in the neck.",Not Recommended," November 3, 2019"

Resident Evil 2 Remake is a great comeback that make justice to the original.

The game starts just like the classic, we take control of two iconic characters: Leon S. Keneddy and Claire Redfield, the main story is slightly different from each other as well as the accessible areas, obtainable items etc. Just by arriving at the police station can feel the tension and can be unnerving. Sound is highly detailed and makes honor to the title ‚ÄúSurvival Horror game‚Äù, the sound of zombies breaking the windows or screaming is terrifying. I highly recommend to use a good pair of headphones with Dolby Atmos.

Resident Evil shows me what a zombie is suppose to be meant, they are more tough and can die from several bullets, however overall enemies are not bullet sponges if you land your shots correctly. Puzzles are back and remembers me to the original game, sprint room to room to find a certain key or item can be very satisfying specially after minutes of search.

There are 3 difficulties: while the first one meant to be for those who like to enjoy the main story, Standard is more balanced and can be for everyone, you can save unlimited times and found a very decent ammount of ammo and healing items but for people looking for a challenge Hardcore is the right choice, follows the same pattern as past resident evil games: enemies are stronger, fewer items, ammo and can only save using a Ink Ribbon. NG+ exist but you cannot carry any inventory or weapons from past saves but instead can choose to start a new Leon or Claire B (2nd run) meaning we start again but in another perspective of the main story, some items are different placed as well for puzzles.",Recommended, March 27

I finally summoned the courage to beat this game after being terrified of the unstoppable Mr. X stalking me to the ends of the Earth. Then I went and beat it a 2nd time. This game will go down in history as being one of the best remakes of all time. Somehow Capcom has done the impossible again. After REmake was notable for being one of the best remakes ever, they have gone and improved upon everything in every way even more so. It doesn't feel like a cash grab. It doesn't feel completely different. It feels like it is a complete upgrade from the original, while doing the original justice, AND feels fresh and new.

Horror, Item management, Survival, Atmosphere, Next-Gen Graphic, Performance, Story etc. Everything is perfect except it lack of the feature that identify the original RE 2. I'm talking about Zapping. In the original, all campaign affect one another. Leon A affect Claire B. Claire A affect Leon B. But in this one, all Leon A/B Claire A/B is just ""What if"".

The original Resident Evil 2 is still to this day held by many to be the absolute best of the classic Resident Evil games. Whether it was the fact it greatly expanded on the first games foundation, the characters it introduced, or the unique scenario mechanics that influenced both protagonists gameplay, It is a fan favourite that helped to put the series on the map. After Capcom created one of the finest survival horror games ever in the Resident Evil 1 remake, fans of the second game waited patiently for their most cherished instalment to get the same treatment. To say that expectations for RE2s remake were high would be an understatement.

It delivered.
------------------------------------------
An important note. My experience with this game at the time of typing is two hardcore playthroughs, a difficulty designed for series veterans, first with Claire, and then with Leon. Enemies are much more durable, saving requires the franchise classic consumable Ink Ribbon and disables auto saves. Basically, my experience may greatly differ from your own should you decide to pick the game up, I don't know what the other two difficulties are like, but I assume they'll be A LOT more forgiving than hardcore. So like with most reviews, take what I say with a grain of salt.
------------------------------------------

We'll begin with the plot, anyone who is familiar with the original will be right at home, Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield are paying a visit to Raccoon City, Leon is disturbed by the lack of communication from his soon to be co-workers at the police station and decides to pay them a visit, while Claire is looking for her brother, Chris Redfield who has seemingly gone missing and has not been in contact.

It doesn't take long for both of our protagonists to realise that something has gone terribly wrong, as a city wide virus has infected the entire populace of Raccoon City, turning them into flesh craving, gore hungry zombies. Following safety protocols, our rookie cop and college student head to the police station to seek shelter, of course if the first game in the series taught us anything, it's that taking shelter in large dark structures prompts the survival horror.

And here we are, Welcome to the Resident Evil 2 remake, where the old rules apply first and foremost. Your objective? Escape. How? By solving the many puzzles that populate the locales in order to ultimately reach the aforementioned goal, all while being hounded and craved for by the former citizens of Raccoon City. You might think ""Oh it's a third person shooter, I'll just kill everything"", WRONG.

This is survival horror, you're not blasting away through anything, you're desperately trying to conserve what you find because ammo is extremely limited and extremely valuable as the numbers you face are plentiful. The same goes for medicinal health herbs and first aid sprays, any spare gunpowder lying around or any new weapons you can hopefully find.

This is what made the classic Resident Evils great. They are games of constant decision making and the tension that results from the choices you make. More often than not, it is better to outright evade zombies in corridors or rooms because you just cannot spare the ammo to put them down, you already used your supply in cleaning out a small handful of rooms of the undead, but you need to find the 3 statues in order to grab the medals to get out of here, but that means you have to go up the stairs on the west side... and ""they"" are there. Maybe you could spare the health? But how much more can you afford to lose before it starts becoming a real problem?

It's something that is difficult to put into words, but the thrill of evading genuinely threatening monsters and hearing the satisfying clicks of puzzles solved create a remarkable and unique experience that sticks with you, whenever progression is made, you feel some relief and accomplishment, before realising that you now need to find where that next crucial piece of the puzzle may be... and right when you feel like you might have things figured out...

(Minor gameplay related spoiler, but avoid reading if know next to nothing about the game, it's worth it.)









Much like the RE1 remake, they made sure to crank up atmosphere and detail to exceptional levels. The dark, damp and torn police station is lovingly recreated, enhanced by the dimly lit flashlight your protagonist will carry around, areas are unsettling as blood smears the walls while the grotesque sights make you wince your eyes.

The ambience adds to the experience in a way I can only describe as exemplary, the silent creaking of chandeliers, the disturbing soundtrack that will cause brief pause before pushing on, the vicious screams and growls from the most hungry of zombies to the most terrifying of foes.

All of these elements combined along with very strong replay value help to create one of the most engrossing survival horror experiences the industry will ever see. The Resident Evil 2 Remake is a remarkable accomplishment and the team responsible for this game should feel nothing but pride for their achievement. It is a return to form, a return to greatness and a love letter to fans of the original game.

I recommend, wholeheartedly.

Game's good. Thank you for reading!

Well, that's not all...I'm writing more of a recommendation on the technical aspects.
There is no in-game benchmark, but a graphics preview, which is useful. The VRAM-USAGE indicator not so much.
The big ""issue"" or choice is edges/ aliasing vs a very soft image.
I've tried a lot and I want you to save time on tuning and play the game instead. Believe me, you need a ROCK-SOLID 60 fps on this title. Which at this point is impossible due to the volumetric lighting in some areas, but the game provides a lot of options. Don't use Direct X12 for now! Direct X11 is 20% faster! No visual difference, in my opinion.
Resolution and interlaced image allow to run at 60 fps even on older hardware, so here's my advice:

- Turn on TAA+FXAA
- Turn on ALL of the post-effects, yes, motion blur too
- If you struggle to geta a ROCK-SOLID 60 fps, use the resolution scaling or the interlaced image feature

A lower resolution makes the image less sharp, but the TAA+FXAA makes a 1080p image so soft, it really does not matter as much. Also, chromatic aberation and lens-distortion seem like a bad choice, but I liked the movie-like look. Well implemented effects.
Hope this helped. ENJOY!",Recommended," February 10, 2019"

Being based on one of the most beloved games in the franchise and coming after the, especially at the time of release, incredible remake of the first RE game, RE2 had big shoes to fill.

I'm glad to say Capcom nailed the project, almost in its entirety. From the new, dark and thick atmosphere to reworked puzzles and areas, combat and controls that are modernized enough to feel comfortable without plunging the player straight into the action game territory of some of the more modern episodes in the series, RE2 is a remake done just right.

And how not to mention the imposing Tyrant (Mr. X for his old friends), which will stalk the corridors of the police station, his stomping to be heard from the other side of the building, closer and closer to your location.

The only sad note I must add is related to the second scenario of the game, unlocked after finishing your first playthrough, which only adds a couple new weapons and skips/reworks some of the early bits of the game, instead of providing exciting new locations and situations. This lack is likely dictated by time and budget constraint, but it nonetheless feels like a wasted opportunity that would have made a great game even better.

Regardless of that, RE2 is one of the best horror games of the last decade, and one every fan of the genre is obliged to play through at least once.",Recommended," November 27, 2019"

There are rarely any games that I follow into the hype. However, my friends over on the Xbox side recommended this to me heavily. Considering that I loved RE7 and the gameplay on the Xbox One. I was hoping RE2 would give me the same experience now I have a proper PC to play games with. While I never played the original RE2, I can safely say that I have fallen in love with this game. The gameplay feels immersing, the story keeps me on edge, and despite usually not being into horror games all that much.

I decided to update my review and post the one I made few months after release of Resident Evil 2 / Biohazard RE:2, because I like it more but at some point I was sure it's lost (I found it on my second HDD). So enjoy!

I was hoping to post this review earlier, but sadly I had no chance - I was to busy enjoying this masterpiece. Beware! My review containt spoilers and opinions made as a huge fan since first game. At this stage it's only made on my experience with first Leon's scenario, so don't be mad if there are some errors in my review :) I wonder where I should start. There are so many things I want to say about this game, how I felt during my first playthrough, how I feel playing it even now. So maybe I will start from saying that original Resident Evil 2 was never my favorite game and I completed it very few times. I probably haven't catched every easter egg, details and such snatched into this Remake. Still, I felt very nostalgic running around Raccoon Police Station. ""I know this place!"", ""This is where the first Licker was!"". Seeing a classic game in the modern visuals is a fantastic feeling. Once again, I felt like a kid who discovers the magic of survival horror for the first time.

About my first run. I was thinking that since the classic RE games are my favorite, I should start with hardcore: you know, enemies are harder, limited times of saves because of ink, avoiding enemies and such. That was, at the time, good idea. Oh, and I was thinking using a Steam Controller, which I used to play for like few hours, would be a great idea. I failed the first section around 8 times. I managed to miss every shot twice. I'm yet no used to it so I switched back to keyboard and mouse. Ah, it was much better!

Clearing the gas station was easy. Then, starting in the middle of the horror, that was just awesome. I mean, I'm running this game on rather old PC and all I can hope for are medium/high settings and yet, everything looked so freaking great. Resident Evil 2 (Remake) set a new high standards for the visuals in modern gaming. And I know this game could look even better on maximum settings! The zombies looks super disgusting, cutting their legs, hands, exploding heads, everything feels just right. Their moans, way the behave, how they are ""waving"" and making it harder to land a good hit, the way they hits the windows and boards - trust me, it's really scary if you are using a headset. At times I was thinking that maybe it would be better to just let zombie in and kill every one, so there could be some quiet time. But yeah, we all don't have enough ammo for that. The lights are also doing a great job to make this game even more scary: sparks, fire, flashlight, and you know there must be something lying in the darkness. Really, there were only few games that made me ""WOW, IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL!"": Far Cry, Crysis, and now RE2 joins the club.

Since I mentioned zombies, these are not the only one that are disgusting. Yeah, you know it: Lickers! While playing, I felt that Hunters in the remake of the first Resident Evil wasn't that bad. As I mentioned, or not, I'm not a very skillful player. Jumping around, crawling at rather fast pace, and being a really tough opponent, Lickers are the worst kind of enemies. There were a time at the lab when two of them jumped out and it really was bad for my ammo and health (both mine and Leon's). I haven't yet played every scenario so I probably haven't met every type of enemies. Anyway, normal (not boss) monsters are really well done and everything feels like a threat to a player.

But, the bosses! I feel like the crocodile part was rather easy, it wasn't also that hard in original RE2, and yet I managed to die at this sequence. Sucks to be me, lol. One of the best part of bosses was definitely Mr. X. After meeting this guy, after he doesn't seem to care if it's a save room or not, I was really happy. I mean, have you ever played Resident Evil 3 and fought against Nemesis? Yeah, this guy gives you the same vibe in the Resident Evil 2 Remake. I felt a huge relief and because of this I know people at Capcom will do a great job on the remakes of other Resident Evil games. So Mr. X is unbeatable (at some point), you don't want to waste ammo on him, but also you don't want him to get closer. Solving puzzles while running away, trying to explore new areas while running away, hearing just those stomp sounds of his - this is such a perfect job. I wasn't feeling safe no matter where I was: is he around? Will he enter this room? Will he smash another wall to jump and kick my butt? This is how bosses in survival horrors should be made! And there is one more guy, Birkin, but he wasn't my favorite or anything. Until the last fight... this part of game was also something amazing. Probably one of the best boss fights in Resident Evil franchise! It's so intense, the final Birkin's form looks terrifing, it's just perfect for the (almost) last fight.

I'm not sure if there is much I can say about weapons, since in the Leon's first sceneario there aren't many. But, I really liked the flamethrower (it's fun to burn zombies!) and... handgun. Maybe I need to get used to it, but the shotgun wasn't really my thing, I had a troubles aiming at the zombies heads and if it takes 2-3 shots to hit them (and not even kill) then yeah, I'd rather stick with small pistol. Oh, the subweapons were great but at the same time I felt like I wasted some of them: way too many grenades went into zombies mounths instead of more dangerous enemies. Well, that's just my luck (and lack of skill!)

So, in the end, is this remake any good? In my opinion, it's much better than original. I know original Resident Evil 2 is very high rated game, and it's one of the best classic games ever made, but I feel like I like playing it much more playing than the original. This game is worth every price. Be it at sale, or at full price - as long as you enjoy good games, and perfectly made survival horrors. Resident Evil 2 Remake is my pick for the best game of 2019.

I've never touched any other RE games, this is my first one (I only watched the gameplay of RE Biohazard, the one that came before this). I bought RE2 on sale (Winter 2019) because almost everyone I enquired about how the game was, no one said it was bad. Everyone I talked to, liked it, plus it had very positive reviews too. I love single player games with a good story and I am not disappointed with the game. And I was kinda happy that this RE wasn't FPS because I watched gameplay of the previous RE and I did not like it much even if the story was decent in it.

From a guy who has never played any RE games, I really enjoyed this game. I thought it might get repetitive at some point, but this game always kept me on my toes for most of the story. As for the story itself, it's a decent story. And I like how they allow you to have a second run on the story with the other character's perspective once you finish it with your chosen characte which adds replayability and not to mention the Ghost survivor modes which have a short story on their own. And the gameplay changes a bit too in the second run. Also, the fact that they won't tell every detail of the story to you, you gotta read stuff you come across to know what was going on was a great thing too.

As for my opinion about the game overall, I can't say if it's worth the full price, but definitely worth buying on sale.",Recommended," December 24, 2019"

After a decade of disappointing RE games, Capcom dug deep and finally came up with their superweapon, the highly demanded RE2 Remake.

After some years of using Steam, i`m about to make my first review and I`m really glad that is about RE2 Remake (also my first pre-purchased game(I regret nothing)). As a fan of the first games (not just the camera thing, but the zombie thematic) I'm really happy to see how REmake is absolutely fantastic with it's own modern particularities and beign faithful to the original title. It brings a great horror atmosphere that we all love in a game of the genre and a chill in the spine, but in a good way. Honestly, really glad to see the old characters back and see their personalities and relationships growing as they step their foot out of the mess, and I can`t wait for them to improve their remakes by bringing us a sequence to the story with Jill in RE3 Remake.

With a slightly different take from the original story in Resident Evil 2, and a few over-the-shoulder elements, RE2 Remake manages to create a unique feeling of dread and panic. The game turns away from the action entered gameplay as seen in Resident Evil 4, and focuses solely on horror. Gone are the quick time events, unlimited supplies of ammo, and giant hordes of weak zombies following you.

During most of the game (if you haven't got used to it), you'll feel trapped and helpless. With only a few supplies available to you, and limited inventory space, you'll have to think twice before unloading your precious bullets on a zombie that most likely will not die from that run and gun decision.

Easily the most interesting part of the game is Mr. X, who changed from a pack of expendable henchmen to a single, immortal, entity. Mr. X will follow you around the station, with solely objective of finding you. His footsteps are the best way to describe him, as they are loud and often comes from confusing directions, forcing you to sit in a safe room until you think the outside is clear... just to end up face to face with him once you finally leave.

This game made want a Resident Evil 3 remake as well, and if Nemesis is anything like Mr. X I will certainly buy that remake if it ever comes out.",Recommended," November 27, 2019"

When one of the most beloved games of all times is remade, there are essentially two possible outcomes:

1) The game is a cash-grab and spits on the legacy of its' progenitor.
2) The game is amazing... no... like, really amazing; everything that could be hoped for and then some.

The remake of Resident Evil 2 falls into the second category. Is the game flawless? No. Does it represent a major leap forward in game design? No. Is it a faithful - best-in-class - representation of what the Survival Horror genre can be? Yes.

While the game differs from the original quite significantly in some ways, other details - many of them easy to overlook - have been painstakingly recreated with obvious love that cannot be overstated; as an example, the original menagerie of zombie faces-and-models have been gloriously updated in what might seem like a strange bit of attention-to-detail, but this greatly helps the remake maintain a generalized similarity to the visuals of the original that might otherwise be lost because graphics have changed so much in the intervening twenty years.

One thing I can't say that I'm an enormous fan of are the redesigns of the three main characters, Leon, Claire, and Ada. We have seen all of these characters in other games since their introduction and - like their counterparts Chris and Jill in - the liberties taken with their design simply don't add anything to their character and might actually distract veterans of the series from what is otherwise an amazing game.

The remastered soundtrack is brilliant in its' own way but the original was, is, and will remain one of the seminal scores ever composed for a video game. In that light, I feel that it might be best to play through the game as one character with the new music and the other character with the old; mileage might vary.

Regarding the actual mechanical components of the game itself... There remains little to be said beyond the age old wisdom: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Under similar scrutiny the graphics can hardly be faulted; they retain much of the campy charm that the original had on the while simultaneously being a nearly immeasurable leap forward in fidelity because, well, twenty years of GPU technology goes a long way when everything is dark and covered in blood.

TLDR: It's a great remake and you should play it whether or not you're new to the series or a tried and true veteran of Umbrella's scheming.",Recommended," November 27, 2019"

The original re2 was the very first truly scary game that I've played as a kid. So much so that it actually made me hide under my desk as I was getting eaten by zombies because I couldn't figure out the controls on the PC. Years later I've revisited these classics to play them through, and without a doubt re2 was the one I enjoyed the most from the older ones. And now they made a remake of the 2nd game and it's just as awesome! Lots of things has changed with this remake, the gameplay, new areas to explore, new enemies, new game modes (in which in one of them you can play as multiple tofus) etc. Capcom has truly poured their heart and soul into this game, and it definitely shows and it deserves the praise! 9/10

However there were only a very small amount of nitpicks here and there:
-like how the 2nd run in the campaign isn't all that drastically different, while in the original there were some pretty interesting events and somewhat different outcomes on each run. If these moments weren't added into the remake, then they could've at least make these scenarios intertwine with each other properly, but sadly that isn't the case.
-Mr X is now way more terrifying in this remake than in the original for the fact that he now follows you around all the time at multiple parts in the game. However there comes a point where you do figure out how to escape from him to safety without any issue, but you are still somewhat forced to get back to safe areas and just wait for him to leave in order to solve the puzzles in peace, which can be pretty annoying. Or you can just waste your ammo on him, which obviously isn't a good idea.
-Also most of the death scenes were done way better in the original, they were more gory.
-And finally how meh the soundtrack was for this game, the moments where things get tense or in the boss fights however the music does stand out. However they actually added the option for you to change the soundtrack to the original 98 version which is so freekin cool, re2's original soundtrack is probably the best in the entire series. Unfortunately it does cost real money but it was worth it for me.",Recommended," April 1, 2019"

I got this for free when I bought a new graphics card, and am absolutely amazed with the quality of this remake. I played the original when it first came out and must say that I'm very much enjoying coming back to RE2 after all these years.

Great graphics and cutscenes, and a lot of improvements over the original. Some of the new features make the remake a lot easier than the original, but hardcore gamers can choose another difficulty level - so everyone's happy! A must-buy for survival horror game fans.",Recommended," June 29, 2019"

After finishing the campaign 8 times, all the DLC missions and getting 100% achievements, it's time I give a mini, spoiler free, review. I played the original RE2 when it was released 20 years ago. It's the first and the best resident evil game I've played. And I've played ALL RE games that are available on PC. RE7 took me by surprise and it was really good. This one tops RE7. Today, Capcom faithfully remade RE2 (I'm so glad they chose to use RE2 as their first 'remake' project). It's called 'remake' and not 'remastered' because it was completely remade from scratch/ground up, using RED engine (RE7). It is NOT an 'enhanced' edition of the original RE2. But they stayed faithful to the original game, redesigned the entire game while retaining the tension, horror aspect, story, etc and made them so much better for 2019 audience. And they are really successful at that.

PROS:
+ amazing graphics, especially the cutscenes.
+ In-game rendered cutscenes
+ Great plot and some very emotional / realistic facial expressions.
+ manage to keep me tensed/scared throughout the game, yet addicted to find out what happens next.
+ great PC port with many graphical settings to customize to your computer's specification. does not feel like a cheap console port.
+ very good story and single player campaign that seems so rare nowadays in the growing sea of oversaturated multiplayer shooters.
+ although they share many similarities in puzzle solving and plot points, both Leon and Claire have their own distinct campaigns, guns/weapons that are only available to them, unique accessible areas. so, it's a joy to run through both campaigns. Even the new game (second run) has some differences to the first campaign.
+ Excellent puzzles that can all be solved in-game without using a walkthrough if you explore all parts of the game.
+ I dont know about other countries, but in my country, the price of the game is less than half the price of other full price AAA games.
+ does not charge microtransactions (even though they could have done so) for powerful guns early in the game, bullets, healing items, cosmetic skins, etc. Respect.

- not all the gameplay graphic looks as amazing as the cutscenes. sometimes at some part, I wish the graphic looks better than it is. but overall, it's excellent.
- some consider the game short. For me, it is just nice. Average gamers will probably take about 6 to 8 hours to complete a single campaign.
- Does not support multi-GPU (Nvidia SLI / AMD CF), but you can easily tweak the Nvidia inspector and use a custom SLI profile for it and it works quite well.
- game might be too scary/gory for some to indulge.

If you like all the PROS I've listed and you like what you saw on the trailer as well as RE series, buy it. Capcom deserved to be praised and supported for their effort in this. If my review is not convincing enough, just take a quick look at the overall reviews on steam. Currently at the time of my writing, it's standing at ""OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE"".

After this RE 7 trash which was called RE but don't know why they named it that because it had nothing to do with RE at all , we finally got a really good one ok its a Remake but i don't care . Now we got our beloved fav characters back , and a really good quality in grafic but grafic alone is not really makeing a game good as we can see at EA games . If you are a little adchievment hunter i am sure your will have your fun at least for around 40-50 hours or more ,in this game .
And what also is a very good plus for me at this game is the german voice acting is so much better than the english ones .
So good Job here .

The only thing i criticize at this game is the very limited character control there is no real counter or knife combat , no dodge or combatroll also no sprint. That means the enemys or bosses also have just very limited mechanics to attack you . What i personally also don't like is in order you want an S or S+ Rank all that matters is the time . And will very quickly see what this means for the gameplay . They should have extanded the campaign a bit longer so that leon and claire have some parts together which would have made at some points more sense .

But i don't want to spoiler anything more it is definitive worth buying , and i am very sure you will have your fun with it",Recommended," February 8, 2019"

If you've never played Resident Evil before, this is a great game to start. If you have, then you'll love this. It's not quite as good as the original, but that's because the original is a 1998 game that still holds up today and set pivotal standards for the entire franchise. RE2make comes very close, and that's the best we could have hoped for.

A masterpiece of AAA game development and an extremely exceptional PC port. Beautiful graphics and haunting atmosphere. PC controls are surprisingly perfect and well thought out. A true focus on the surviver horror element. If you go about trying to shoot every enemy you encounter, you're going to run out of resources quick. Puzzles are fun to solve. Level design is incredibly good and many areas are even interconnected with shortcuts. Two characters to play as, who boast different weapons, enemy placement, puzzles, and areas unique to their campaign (plus to get true ending you have to beat campaign as the second character you choose to play through). Lot's of bonuses and collectables. Reports (aka challenges) to unlock other cool stuff. No garbage monetization and free dlc already lined up. This is a high quality and polished AAA gaming package easily worth full price of admission. Only issue I had with the game was regarding one of the final cutscenes in Leon's campaign where the voice audio lines were delayed and not properly lined up with what was going on. Besides that Resident Evil 2 was a perfect experience and sets a very high bar for any future remakes from AAA devs.

Easily the best Resident Evil game next to RE4 ever made. It is all the best gameplay elements of the original series combined with the best gameplay pioneered in Resident Evil 4. The game has endless replay value due to multiple stories, challenges, and unlockables. The story is just different enough to expand on the original RE2 while changing particular moments to surprise even return fans of the series.

The game's horror is a really good combination between gore and jump scares and the enemies are threatening enough to keep players on their toes. Eariler actions drastically affect later areas the player returns too and the dual story of Leon/Claire changes locations of enemies, weapons, and puzzles so as to not get too repetitive. The bonus stories, outfits, and special weapons unlocked upon completing the game gives great incentive, and the free DLC coming soon is a nice bonus.",Recommended," January 30, 2019"

Introduction

RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2 is a remake of the original 1998 Resident Evil 2 video game. In this game, you'll be put in control of mainly Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, in an attempt to escape from Racoon City during the zombie apocalypse that is going on. Released worldwide on January 25th 2019, is a great remake and could very well be the definition of what a remake should be when it comes to a video game.


- Steam Store page description.

, due to the nature of the game, has the same story as that of the original 1998 video game. However, spoilers will not be revealed here in spite of this to satisfy others. Needless to say, the story is pretty good and is satisfying to watch from beginning to end. I completed within about five hours, including cutscenes, deaths, side-tracking, etc.

I completed Claire's story via the [2nd Run] method and got more story out of it, however I suggest doing Claire's story via the main run before doing any [2nd Run] attempts, due to the remixed item layouts and Mr. X timing. You should not complete one character's story and then drop the game, as you will be missing out on half the game.


Gameplay in feels like a cross between the original video game and that of but much moreso that of the latter. No more are the tank controls and fixed camera angles, as you are able to move much more freely. You'll typically find ammo for the type of gun you want around the many areas of the game, and you'll even see some remixed areas compared to the original, to keep players of the original on edge also.

Handling of the guns, sub-weapons, etc. is done very well, all guns feel good to use and none really feel as if they shouldn't be in the game due to being particularly weaker than others or being much stronger than others. Weapon types feel as strong as they should be and more often than not, the player should be attempting to avoid combat, so stunning a zombie rather than killing is preferred.

Inventory management still holds up on being entertaining, with the management system making you think about what you must take and what you must forego, sometimes even completely discarding an item. You cannot discard ""Key Items"" until the item does not need to be used anymore, which makes management a bit easier. You can find pouches to increase the amount of items you can hold at once, though many are optionally found and can be quite easily missed. Keep a look out, as you'll definitely want increased inventory slots in the late game.


features a mostly ambient soundtrack which really immerses you into the gameplay, adding moments of tense feeling and doubt as you traverse the areas in the game. You'll additionally hear soundtracks being played during boss battles or during certain moments, which all fit within the game.

While I have yet to try it, if you buy the DLC or bought the Deluxe Edition, you may use the original soundtrack in favour of the new, remake soundtrack. Original soundtrack is very much so more creepy and ambient and may add to the fear factor of the game for some. All in all, the soundtrack we have is great and fits the mood and themes of the game.


runs on the which is an in-house engine built by Capcom, originally for and repurposed and further built upon for the remake.

has been known to be very well optimised and offering very good framerates and scalability between lower and higher-end hardware. Thanks to the further developments made for the remake on the engine, I personally have noticed a more optimised and polished experience than I did on and on higher quality settings no less! It is without a doubt that for many players, the remake is a very well optimised piece of software and can run on many setups.

Please make note that the VRAM Counter in the settings menu appears to be incorrect or shows you the maximum amount of VRAM that may be used at once instead of what is being concurrently used, as noted by many people. For example, the VRAM Counter displays around about 2.12 GB VRAM being used but actual VRAM usage never jumps above 1.8 GB VRAM used in my case and in other cases the game may report using 12-13 GB but will instead stay around 9+ GB VRAM utilised.

Deluxe Edition offers little in terms of actual gameplay and mostly consists of cosmetic items such as costumes or the original soundtrack. You may not find this to be worthwhile, however the price is only slightly higher than that of the base game. Main game experience shouldn't be different based on your version of the game. You may buy the DLC seperately if you do not wish to buy the Deluxe Edition but want a particular DLC instead. You can find these here:





Demo is no longer available and as such, benchmarking or finding approximate performance results must be done elsewhere. The best solution is to purchase the game and play, as you'll definitely find out if your PC is up to the task before the refund timer expires.


In the end, is a fantastic video game and a really faithful remake of the original video game released back in 1998. I believe that the game is justified in its pricing thus far but I can understand some qualms if you do not wish to play multiple 4-5 hour stories, or less if you know what you're doing.

The remake further pushes into the boundaries of having a very good track record lately compared to many other game developers (this is knowing the drawbacks have had recently too), releasing games such as and eventually the very good looking I very much so hope that keep this up and set themselves apart from other game developers! This gives me very high hopes for

In conclusion, if you like as a series or you'll like this very faithful remake. If you find yourself not enjoying the game in the under two hour mark, you may always refund.",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

More Tedium than Survival Horror

Ever since I played the remake of Resident Evil 1 on the Gamecube I had been wanting to see my favorite title in the Resident Evil franchise get the same treatment. To not only receive a visual facelift from its PS1 origins, but also to expand on weaker portions of the original game while enhancing its strongest aspects. This was the degree of care and devotion I always wanted to see out of a remake of Resident Evil 2, but what I got was a mediocre game seemingly uninterested in the title it was supposedly remaking.

The general gameplay feels like a chore. Zombies are bizarrely resilient and usually require multiple headshots to put down, and often they'll just get back up a second, third, or even FOURTH time. Even a shotgun blast to the face can not only be survived on rare occasion, but it doesn't even flinch zombies sometimes. This makes all of your weapons feel weak and ineffective. In the original RE2, blasting a hallway full of zombies would likely kill two outright and knock down all the ones behind them. Here it's lucky if you even kill one and flinch the guy directly behind them with a single shotgun blast.

However, zombies and other enemies can't kill you most of the time. Outside of a few rare instant kills (which you can counter with certain items), you can never die unless your health was already at ""Danger"" when you were attacked. I usually like the mercy of a normally fatal attack leaving you a single hitpoint to try and recover from, but here it adds to the grindfest of ""surviving"". Zombies and others grab onto you with very slow and uninterruptible canned animations (there's no option to button mash for a faster escape like in most games), after which your character knocks them off, you're given mercy invincibility to get back up, use a healing item (there's plenty), which lets you repeat the whole tedious process.

I can't stress enough how much a slog this makes the game. In both old and newer Resident Evil games, certain enemies would be terrifying as they could often kill you even if you were at high health. The original lickers had a jumping slash that dealt a near instant kill from the damage it did while even a more action-focused title like RE4 featured vicious enemies with chainsaws that could kill you instantly if they connect an attack. This kept encounters tense, you never truly felt safe, even if you're sitting high at full health with a lot of ammo because a couple or even a single mistake can spell game over; that is not the case with REmake 2, it's just tedious.

This means the best strategy is just to avoid enemies, which becomes the core approach to gameplay altogether; avoid playing as much of it as possible. Avoiding enemies has always been a core aspect of most Resident Evil games, but here it feels like instead of trying to conserve ammo and other resources for bosses and more difficult encounters, I'm doing it because fighting enemies are so dull I'd rather skip it. I'd often have plenty of handgun bullets to clear out zombies, but it takes so long and is so tedious I didn't want to.

This tedium extends to the non-combat aspects of the gameplay. Of all things I love about the old Resident Evils inventory management wasn't one of them, and having tiny keys take up an eighth of my inventory was absurd twenty years ago. There's no key item section like in RE4, nor even a SINGLE key item space unique to the character like in older games, or separate inventory slots for sub-weapons like REmake 1 featured. EVERYTHING takes up a space, sometimes two.

Most of the puzzles don't fare much better. I enjoy the safes and lockers whose combinations are found by reading files or paying attention to your surroundings; this rewards the player for exploring and feel natural. Less so are miniature safes that require no logic to deduce but just memorizing which lights are connected to which buttons; it's trial and error. Much like so many other aspects of the game, it's best skipped when possible, which is easier since most puzzles have set solutions (except the mini-safes...).

I know I've talked almost exclusively about the gameplay but that's because a lot of the original game's iconic cutscenes have been recreated just as haphazardly. Despite the MASSIVE jump in graphics and the ability to shoot cutscenes in much more dramatic ways, most of the original game's biggest scenes now feel rushed at best and phoned-in at worse. It's clear the people in charge of REmake 2 didn't have much faith in RE2's story but were forced to remake it anyway. It feels like a student doing JUST enough work to get a C-, it's passable but only just barely and certainly not worthy of praise.

Even the music feels uninspired. The dramatic and iconic tracks of the original game are replaced with subdued and generic ones that almost feel like placeholders at times. With the exception of Mr. X's new theme, none of the music stands out to me. However, the game does give you the option of switching over to the original tracks, but only if you pay an extra $3 for it‚Ä¶ and even then it doesn't replace the music in the cutscenes, despite some of the original game's most memorable tracks being tied with important cutscenes.

Most disappointedly, despite some rigid insistence of recreating most of the original RE2 without much understanding of it, a lot of its most ambitious features were dropped. The original game in addition to having two characters each with their own supporting cast and subplot also had an A scenario and B scenario, where certain bosses and plot points are only unveiled when you complete a second playthrough with the other character you didn't beat the game with. This REmake will try to claim it's maintained this feature with its ""2nd Run"", but it's a facade.

The differences between 1st and 2nd run are minimal with the biggest being the true final boss tacked on the end of the 2nd run. Unlike the original RE2, your actions in the first scenario don't affect the second one. You can't possibly screw yourself over by taking a couple of valuable items that you didn't know wouldn't respawn for the second character or see unique scenes you only got by going second. You always fight the same three bosses in the same places with either character in either run, and you always get the exact same character-specific scenes, of which there are a few that blatantly contradict each other despite there being fewer variations to account for.

This lackluster remake would be more passable if it had more features, but there's not a lot to keep you coming back. That there are even fewer changes between different characters and different scenarios gives you less reason to replay the main story. You can try to earn a higher ranking either for bragging rights or infinite ammo weapons, but even that isn't challenging once you figure out the game's various quirks. There's the 4th Survivor scenario, but it's incredibly short and there are no in-game leaderboards to compare times with. And even the Ghost Survivors DLC was little more than a brief novelty.

The lack of replay value stings more when you remember the numerous rereleases of RE2 in the past tried to add more value with each incarnation. The Dual Shock version added ""Extreme Battle Mode"", an action-centric sub-mode where you could play as multiple characters trying to fight your way back into the police station to shut off bombs that had been set-up. The N64 version included a randomizer option, which randomized all non-key items in the game, meaning no two playthroughs would be quite the same.

I think REmake 2 may have finally broken my Resident Evil addiction. It's not spectacularly bad, but it's frustratingly unambitious. Most everything it does has been done better, often in the very game it was remaking, and when not there in other Resident Evil installments. If that's all I got to look forward to from the franchise, I'd be better off calling it quits.",Not Recommended," February 7, 2019"

I cannot reccomend this enough if you love horror. The Resident Evil franchise has been a favorite of mine since RE4. It's awesome to go back to Leon and Clair with a completely revamped graphics and gameplay. This kept me on edge the whole time and I had to have company to play it.

Background: I played on Normal difficulty as Leon and then Clair and explored probably 95% of the maps.

Pros:
-The voice acting and mocap are outstanding
-Immersive sound track and terror inducing musical cues
-Satisfying zombie destruction physics
-Clever remixing of classic puzzles
-Good balance of challenges
-Outstanding lighting and environments

Cons:
-Each campaign only takes about 8 hours, even with comlplete exploration
-Rules to mechanics not always clear
-Minor glitches that distract from immersion
-Directional sound could be improved
-DLC content slightly dissapointing",Recommended," January 30, 2019"

Resident Evil 2 was and easily my favorite game of all time and this remake is like a God send for us!
This game is absolutely amazing.
Great graphics, great atmosphere, great horror elements and it's fun af!
Hardcore mode is not only hard as hell, but the experience is unforgettable.

Unlike the first Remake (RE HD Remaster), this game isn't a simple remake, but it's a totally game changer.
The puzzles aren't the same.
The RPD is way bigger with many locations.
The story is slightly different as well.
Mr.X now is like Nemesis from RE3.

and you wanna know what is the best part? This game has revisited and implemented many ideas and locations from the scrapped RE1.5!
Capcom knew that the beta RE2 was so popular and it's really good on them to implement many elements from it into RE2make.

The PC port is also very optimized and runs like butter.

People complain about the game being short, but they are forgetting that the game has multiple scenarios of 2 characters, plus 2 extra side scenarios! just like the original game!
It's totally worth it, get the game!

In a world where a lethal virus turns people into rotten beasts that roam around the dead cities while screeching at their top of their lungs, I boot up Resident Evil 2 Remake where things look a bit more hopeful so far. Such a beautiful game! You can spend hours scrutinizing the detailed, perfectly underlit, somewhat open-ended environments and smooth models. Just make sure to keep an eye on the wandering Inspector Gadget who would punch your teeth out without a second thought should you stop paying attention.

I also loved the famous transforming boss, Doctor Birkin, another perfectly carried over, classic RE design. Always felt bad for the poor sod. While nailing the big attractions, the remake is all about details, like that separate animation for the rare occurrence when two zombies grab you at once! Cool, eh? I appreciate it when developers put thought into such seemingly unimportant stuff. Of course, none of this would matter if the controls weren't so flawless. The gunplay, in particular, is almost too comfy for a horror game. And it was one of the several reasons why I personally didn't find my experience that scary, at least on Normal.

The game is Intense in all the right places, yes, but not very oppressive in tone. Maybe the absence of cinematic camera angles plays its role, too. It may sound blasphemous, but I wouldn't mind more jumpscares in general and additional surprise monster spawns while backtracking, just to put on some more pressure and to drain ammo. By the end of both campaigns (Leon A + Claire B) I usually mustered quite an arsenal: tons of health items, like 30 something grenade launcher/shotgun ammo, and you should've seen my collection of knives! To boot, the typewriters are on every corner, there're autosaves every couple of minutes... you get the picture.

Does it really matter? Well, yes, but the peculiar atmosphere of a zany zombie flick is still there and this is what actually counts in my opinion. I might even say that I was having too much fun to be scared! And don‚Äôt get me wrong - the Remake isn‚Äôt easy, just not soul-crushingly brutal. The original never was, too, but this one is a great deal more accessible to the general public, which is fine by me. Want a deeper horror experience that is somewhat closer to the originals? Play it on Hardcore, they even got Ink Ribbons there. Ultimately, I enjoyed the game as a fun, profound action-adventure. It's a different take with a different vibe, but the same unerring formula. Polished, clean, classy... mwa!

RESIDENT EVIL 2

Resident Evil 2 is simply the greatest remake ever created, period. It's now the standard by which all remakes will be compared to and for good reasons. It improves and removes pretty much all aspects of what made the old Resident Evil games tedious and frustrating to play and make them better than ever before. Let's count down what this game got right:

1. No more fix camera angles
I can't even begin to stress how much more fun the game is without this needless and useless implementation of the past. Exploration is now funner and faster, and maneuvering your characters has never been easier and more intuitive.

2. The transition to 3rd person over-the-shoulder shooting
No more will you have to rely on the game auto shooting for you. Now, the freedom to aim however you want and getting critical head shots are entirely up to you. It makes combat less clunky and more engaging than any previous entry in the original trilogy. Players who played the old Resident Evil games will appreciate this change, immensely.


With the technology of today, gone are the days of constantly having to watch a loading screen every time you enter a new area. With how much this game emphasizes exploration and and backtracking, this improvement is no doubt the most appreciated of them all.


It sounds like such a simple upgrade, but it makes a huge difference in a Resident Evil game. Backtracking is no longer as prevalent and tedious in Resident Evil 2 because you have so many opportunity to upgrade your backpack making the flow of exploration MUCH more enjoyable and fun to play.


The map in this game does much more than just show your current location. It makes every thing from showing which key is for which door, where items are remembered on the map, whether there are still more items to be found with the use of color coding, and how to open certain doors more clear than ever making exploration even better and effortless.

Here's a quick run down of everything else Resident Evil 2 got right with this remake:

The graphic is gorgeous and beautiful to look at; It elevates the horror to a whole new level. The dialogue and voice acting is superior in every single way. The atmosphere is incredible and unrelenting; You are at the mercy of the city, and you truly feel like it. The varieties of enemies are also adequate presenting just enough with each to make fights and encounters feel different enough. The level design is superb, and the puzzles are never too hard to solve but enough to be enjoyable and engaging.



Resident Evil 2 is a game begging to be replayed over and over again. Literally. From top to bottom and everything in between, this is one of those rare gems that managed to surpass expectations in almost every inconceivable way. Resident Evil 2 has officially redefined what it meant to be a remake.


It's a game absolutely worth playing.",Recommended," November 23, 2019"

Ok, so I picked it up and its REALLY good. One of my new favorite horror games for sure, considering it the first resident evil game I've played. The zombies kinda act like a brick wall on some occasions.. forcing you to either reroute or stagger them my shooting a bullet in their lead sponged heads. ZoMbiEs dOn'T ScAre mE, Throughout the game I learned to stagger and whip out a heavy weapon to finish the job quickly. I enjoyed the bosses and some of the puzzles, but two in particularly ended with me walking back to the room where the flamethrower was, forcing me to use my flamethrower as I learned it to be deadly against the foes I had such a hard time with. After killing all them baddies and losing all my ammo I looked around to find only 4 bullets for my lighting hawk.... I only ran out of ammo once, and it was during the hell hound floor. luckily, I was able to kill the very last 2 with my last shotgun slug, if not for that I would have quit the game and given it a bad rating, luckily that didn't happen,

This game, in my opinion, is a near perfect remake. The game as a whole remains very similar to the original, while making meaningful changes and adding great new content. The new voice acting is actually quite good, while still having the cheesy Resident Evil feel. Additionally, the new controls and camera angle brings the game into the modern age. This new camera angle doesn't take away from the scare factor of this game either, and in several ways I would even say it's scarier. The game looks fantastic to boot, if you have a beefy PC. It's a fantastic jumping off point for someone looking to get into the series, or for a die hard fan looking to relive the classic.

Fantastic game. My first time ever playing Resident Evil 2, not having played the original, it was really fun. The atmosphere was scary, it gave me a feeling of dread exploring the police station and the zombies were genuinely terrifying, their movement and voice acting made them feel real. Having finished Leon A and Claire B, I've clocked 20 hours. There is definitely enough here to feel like you've got your money's worth. The visuals are breathtaking and the game runs great. I can't think of anything bad, I only wish there were more.

RE2 Remake is GOTY#2019 For me at least!
After 20+ years of waiting, it's finally back and bigger & better than ever!
No issues or complaints so far (from my end).
Full review will be written after a couple more hours of actual gameplay.. (Check)!
No spoilers, just my honest opinion of the game in it's current state and value.
I will say this much though, it's an old school RE fan's wet dream come true!

Well, this is my 1st. RE2 Review after having played and finished it with Leon C. after roughly 15 hours (i took my sweet time and started over a few times in the beginning).
What kind of impression or feelings have i got after finishing it the first time (and surely not the last time), well nothing less than sheer amazement and pure love for this game to be honest..

The graphics are as we all can see, practically photo realistic and they just ooze quality and emotions all over the place. I must have spent hours literally looking around at all the amount of detail that has gone into the development of the game. It's simply impressive, to say the least.
The music as we also can expect from Capcom is once again spot on, and if you (like myself) have added the original sound track ect, it only makes things better if you ask me personally..
RE2 has been remade not just exactly like it was in the 90's, but the devs have cunningly added some stuff to the whole of the game without taking anything away from the original, which to me is really great and by doing so they have matched it perfectly into the game's original storyline.

I was actually a bit sad that the game ended a tad abruptly (i still had plenty of ammo and herbs left) that's just to show you how good it really was. (you still need to use your resources wisely, but knowing what i know now, i can honestly say that there's plenty to go around when being smart)
The game itself is on normal difficulty, not that easy (you'll still die) and not that hard.
The lickers are probably the hardest foes you'll encounter, with the exception of the bosses of course.
Knowing what kind of ammo and sub weapons to use on which target is a real life saver!
There's plenty to do within the game, and there's also a lot of backtracking to be done, especially when Mr.X is on your tail..

The game is quite gory and shocking from time to time, but that's precisely why Capcom has made this franchise so outstanding. They have perfectly combined these elements and made it all work into a 3rd person shooter with a gripping story, beautiful animations and cutscenes to keep you on the edge of your seat, from the beginning till the end (if you survive that long MHOEHAHAHA).
Also the game has 2 sides to play, which increases the game's overall length with quite a bit, and there are even more modes to unclock and stuff to unlock such as weapons, costumes, collectables and what not..

All this has made me believe that RE2 Remake would indeed be The Nr.1 contender in it's genre: Survival/Horror to run for GOTY#2019.

I first played this way back in 1998 (I was 18)

Everything old is new again

But, this is a near perfect game. Just flawless. PC controls are tight; UI design and workflow is fluid (I never feel like I'm stuck fumbling in the menu/items/map screens).

Also also god DAMN terrifying. And just the right amount that makes you want to advance further.

After playing this game to absolute death I have to for the most part give Capcom absolute praise for bringing Re2 back for a more modern feel in 2019 compared to the original on the ps1 of 1998. It is literally one of the best re-imaginings of a game that many gamers love and remember.

It's a game that will scare the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of you and have you on the edge of your pc chair no matter how many times you play it because honestly, I thought after doing so many runs of this, that I would get used to the jump scares. NOPE! They still get me everytime and it's sooo satisfying because when it happens, all logic and reasoning goes out the window and you panic. You either shoot what scared the living ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of you or you run screaming and then feel weary of what's around the corner.

Visually it's amazing to look at, sound and tone of the game are pretty indepth but also keeps you alert. The Voice acting is top notch and the story is more or less the same as the original, just some parts were changed about slightly. Other then that, it's an amazing game.

Negatives:
To get police station in the original was survival horror at it's finest, it took a lot of tries and getting used to the game as it throws horde after horde of zombie infested goodness at you. Hell if you got to the police station without picking up any items and surviving by your wits alone, a super zombie, brad vickers would be accessible to kill for a special key that gave you alternative clothing and weapons for characters.

In this version of the game, they have removed doing that completely and you can get to the police station in 2 minutes or less, no hassle, no alternative clothing or weapons and especially NO zombie brad who was killed by nemesis in RE3 and was something that linked RE2 AND RE3 together and they replace it with a very dissapointing poster of Brad Vickers on the 2nd run. So in throwing all that lore out the window, they instead make getting stuff via paid DLC. This to me was the biggest dissapointment of the remake.

My 2nd dissapointment was that in either 1st or 2nd run, Claire and Leon barely have any real interaction with each other, there was so much more in the original. Also they both more or less fight the same bosses in 1st or 2nd run, so it's still the same and nothings really changed.

With the original RE2 you could play LEON A scenario and see what you missed on the CLAIRE B run that tied both of them together, or doing the opposite would also yield different scenarios but more importantly, more diversity, different storylines and dialogue being played out. It's what made the original far more satisfying because it wasn't always the same. Doing both characters A/B runs gave it far more replayability and told are far more interesting story, gave it even greater depth.

The remake sadly doesn't do that and as much as I love this remake, part of me feels like it was a half arsed rush job just to get this game made and so much content was removed that if they kept it to how it was originally this game would be a 10/10 for me hands down, but it's not.

If you played the original 4 different times, you got more storyline and different changes that affected either scenario and you'd be happy to replay the game to see what changed and would have you invested and on the edge of your seat because things WOULD be different.

If you play the remake 4 different times, it's the same the 1st 2 times. If you did 1st run with Leon and then the 2nd run with claire and after completing do the alternative, there's zero differences. Storylines the same, bosses are the same, it's not even worth it trying to do all 4 alternative times because there's effectively only 2.

Is this a great game? Hands down it is. Visually and how it sounds, it's better then the original but in terms of storyline and greater depth, the original RE2 was and still is better then the remake and honestly the PS1 version of RE2 gives you more content, more storyline and more monsters.

""Many Zombies.

9.5/10 Wolfies. üê∫""

Capcom have remastered the original Resident Evil 2 with all new lighting, models, gameplay, graphics etc... They have really captured the essence of the original and have expanded and improved a lot on it. The story is compelling as the original, with many new modes introduced once you complete both Leon and Claire's story.

The game is absolutely terrifying, just when you think you are safe, jump scare of a Zombie, Licker or even MR X will catch you off guard. The new Engine Capcom have used has improved the graphics by a milestone and the motion capture of the Zombies are even more realistic, which adds to the scariness.

Resident Evil is all about puzzles, strict inventory management, terrifying atmosphere and brilliant story to follow. If you played the original or would like to get into Resident Evil then I recommend this to all fans of horror games who really want to get scared and enjoy an amazing game.",Recommended, February 15

10 years ago, resident Evil 4 was my first RE experience on the PS 2, and since then I never had the chance to experience any of the classic RE games that people have been calling a masterpiece, only sequels to RE 4 like RE 5, which was okay, RE 6, which I hated, and RE 7, which was great. Thank god that CAPCOM listened to the fans and gave us this remake as it merged the community of RE fans who prefer its survival horror aspect and fans who prefer its action aspect. You can argue that RE 7 did it first but this game just did it a lot better.
Pros:
(++++) The atmosphere, I felt chills down my spine that I've never felt before when playing a video game
(+++) Mr. X, just when you thought the game was getting a bit easy, this guy joins the party and made exploring the police station ten times more unnerving
(++) Guns are crazy fun to shoot and shooting zombies feel visceral (even though they won't stay dead)
(+) Graphics are amazing and performance is well optimized, lots of setting that you can tweak in order for you to be able to play even on the worst of PCs
(+) Inventory management is super fun and going back and forth to store and get stuff surprisingly doesn't get old
(+) Lots and lots of extra content and replayability
Cons:
(---) Ada and Sherry sections, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• these sections, I don't care if it adds variety to the campaign, give me Leon and Claire as well as my items back
(--) Main campaign is only about 7-8 hours long, 10-12 if you played the second run
(-) Game gets a less and less scary after you get past the police station
(-) The 2 different campaigns aren't that much different
(-) A few low res textures when you look closely in a cut scene, but I'm just nitpicking at this point
I got this game at the winter sale so I'm very glad to say that I got an absolutely HUGE bang for my buck, if you've heard the horrors you'll get through playing this game and feel nervous to try; don't worry. Take it from a wimp like me; it's part of the experience and it'll feel all the more rewarding once you've completed the campaign.",Recommended, January 9

As a new person to the franchise, Resident Evil 2 has given me an excellent occasion to plunge into the universe presented herein, and among other things, served as a great title to conclude the decade with.

Most of the time, the game takes place at a police station overwhelmed with numerous secrets to discover, encouraging to explore even further up to the most remote corners of the facility, regardless of the danger that awaits. Its narrow claustrophobic corridors and passages, music, ambient sounds (zombies moaning trying to break in through the windows, the sounds of weather etc.), the scarcity of ammunition, really pack a punch. Not to mention the tyrant that is on our tail from some point in the game, whom we can only stun for a while.

All these things put together keep in suspense lending the place the atmosphere of anxiety, making clear that any minute you may end up being bitten by a zombie lurking behind a wall.

The gameplay is by no means monotonous, on normal difficulty level the game it is neither too hard nor to easy. The arsenal of weapons is assorted and contains different weapons for both Claire and Leon. The items are laid out in a way that require some backtracking, yet it doesn't feel frustrating because we often get new items, as well as open up new rooms and locations. The graphics of the present generation gives far better impression that in the original game.

Another thing worthy of a mention is the plot, which as far as I know, has been redesigned in some ways, the story of the original version is here just a background to what happens in the remake. It is nevertheless, gripping and riveting. It is divided into two scenarios we choose at the beginning. Upon the completion of the first scenario, there is a second run mode available with the character we didn't choose previously. On the second run, we often have to perform the same actions we did previously, but there is enough of new content that makes it worth a try.

The presence of different scenarios, challenges, achievements and extra game modes makes it fully replayable, but the things get quite repetitive in such a case.",Recommended, January 1

Although the Resident Evil franchise was an integral part of my teenage years, I just couldnt get myself to play the original RE:2 due to how poorly it aged throughout the years (understandably so), and as years went along I helplessly watched one of my favorite franchises take a nosedive in terms of quality with the introduction of more action oriented RE:5 and 6. The radical shift from horror survival to emphasis on third person action/shooting just didnt quite appeal to me ( and to many others ) and just as I was about to give up on the franchise, RE:7 re-ignited my passion towards it. I was stoked to hear CAPCOM was going to remake re:2 because it meant I was finally going to be able to experience it for the first time.

Having never played the original RE:2, I dove headfirst into the remake. I knew the main beats of the story and how it concluded, but as they say, its not about the destination, its about the journey.








Overall its safe to say that I absolutely loved this game and finished it multiple times on different platforms. It's no doubtedly my game of the year and I wish everyone will give this game and the upcoming remake of RE:3 a shot; it holds a great potential to people who havent played any survival horror games to be introduced to a whole new genre, which would be amazing for the overall diversity of the gaming industry to escape from the monolithic openworld or battle-royale mentality and could encourage studios to invest in this amazing genre.",Recommended," December 25, 2019"

I never had the chance to play resident evil 2 back in the day - I rented the original one from the video store and spent a good couple of days not getting anywhere with it when I was a kid and I didn't really ever get back into the resident evil series until 4 (wii version was so good).. from what I've been seeing though it looks like this is most people's favourite.

It turns out that there's a lack of Leon and Claire interactions in this game.

a classic given new life!

i played the original on ps1, although i'll admit i don't remember much since i was way too damn young to be playing it.
that, and i was scared ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.
the original game gave a great sense of dread with its slow, methodical movement and its immense focus on bullying you for being bad at inventory management. it had technical puppeteering, bad voice acting, phenomenal amounts of cheese, and ""it's up to us to take out umbrella.""

fast-forward two decades later where technology has vastly improved, consumers demand more, and journalists suck at videogames to get paid.
capcom decides: ""hey, you remember that game? THAT one? let's remake it!""

so they did, and it's phenomenal.
the once-lit halls of the RPD are now shadowy corridors, everything moves significantly faster, you can smell fire by looking at it, william birkin looks and sounds even more terrifying, and mr. x has a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing fedora. also, fixed camera angles are now replaced with ed the cameraman looking over your shoulder as he does in the newer resident evil games. well, almost all of them.

this game brings everything that there is to be adored from its predecessor, including but not limited to ridiculous puzzles for extremely trivial things, a large part of the game taking place in a building that is way too damn huge and has way too many complex puzzles to be a normal establishment, staring at your inventory for a few minutes at a time, save room music akin to post-nut clarity, and so much more.

this game is beautiful in every aspect, the gameplay feels like a brand new spin on the classic formula that feels greatly respectful of its roots while modernizing it in necessary areas; it's absolutely precious!
this game feels way too replayable for what it is and i always find myself wanting to come back for more playtime with uncle x. the HUNK scenario formula is expanded upon by not only a rebirth of the real deal but also new variants: the Ghost Survivors modes, which were released at a later date for completely free! thank you capcom, very cool.

A modern day classic

RESIDENT EVIL 2/BIOHAZARD RE:2 is a remake of the 1998 play station one classic Resident evil 2.
Resident evil is a survial horror franchise developed and published by capcom. Resident evil 2 has two protagonists fighting their way through the city in the quest of in turn saving it.

Story

Whether you play as Leon or Claire you are terrified to find the state the city is in,a virus breakout turning the city into a nightmare filled with terrifying creatures and hungry zombies at every corner ,and you the hero/heroine the city needs.Both,Leon the rookie looking forward at his first day at work and Claire a brave college student trying to find her brother get sucked into trying to save this virus infested city and finding the reason the city turned into a living undead. Both the main characters find unique and interesting side characters during their escape from the virus infested city.Some of the side characters are really well crafted getting you to care for them.So the story is really straight forward that you are the Savior the city needs but the gameplay and the characters is what makes the game great.The only problem I have is that both the main characters Leon and Claire although have completely different story but traverse the same path and have to solve the same puzzles ,that just makes me a bit disappointed and sad.

Gameplay

The gameplay is frustratingly awesome especially on the hardest difficulty getting you to sweat at every moment.On the hardest difficult especially the ammo management plays a vital role getting you to care for every bullet you fire.Both leon and claire have to deal with unique weapons giving their respective story a different dimension along with the story
There are 3 massive locations you need to explore and fight through in this game dark and silent hallways of RPD ,dirty sewers and an umbrella lab.Each area has multiple puzzles you need to crack to advance.The puzzles are one of the reason that make the original resident evil games so loved and revered. Imo puzzles are heart of a great Resident evil game.
Resident evil 2 does a great job of keeping you on the edge due to its blood thirsty zombies, horrifying creatures and especially Mr X. The sound Mr X's footsteps is a fuel of nightmares,his unflinching face ,his mammoth size makes him much more horrifying and scares the living ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• outa you when you see him outta nowhere.Resident evil 2 does a great job of making you feel your in constant danger due to its ammo and inventory management, awesome zombies and a terrifying atmosphere and background scores.


All in all Resident evil 2 remake is a welcome reminder of how Resident evil games should be like,full of edge of the seat moments,great story and characters and a terrifying atmosphere.Resident evil 2 is a modern day classic and a must play for everyone and especially for fans of the original resident evil games.

I had never played the original but I had a rather good time with this remake.
TL;DR is that it's a fun nostalgic romp but has some issues on a technical level.

My only qualms are to do with consistency.
There were times where I emptied 5 mags (no exaggeration) of ammo into a dead zombie's head only for them to reach up and grab me once I walked past them.

Also the range of the shotgun head explosion kill is really frustrating. You have to get within breathing distance of a zombie to kill it and it's pretty easy to miss.

I also felt that there should have been a more dramatic change between the A and B scenario.

Baloney aside, buy it on sale and you'll have a good time.

Edit: 2019 Steam games were a lil lackluster, but this one was pretty great.",Recommended," August 30, 2019"
834,Miles,"
Hands-down, one of the best story-based zombie games ever made, and my personal GotY for 2019. Graphics are pretty, gunplay makes you count every shot, acting is finally on high standards (compared to classic RE games), exploration is fun and keeps you on edge, and the story, while not being too intricate, has a decent degree of character development.

Stage bosses retain their classic ""weak-spot"" style, while presenting a legitimately scary appearance and challenging fights. The game relies much less on jump-scares than RE7. Replay value is high due to New Game Plus and both protagonists having their own story. Easter eggs and a lot of content, even in the base version, show that Capcom has put a lot of attention to detail into this remake.

The only technical issues I encountered were some collision detection weirdness, DirectX 12 not being useful at all, and reflections having blocky resolution. But that does not detract from the greatness of this game. A bigger problem is the inconsistency created in the story (as compared to the original RE2) by the much bigger overlap between the A and B scenarios, as well as by the lack of the ""zapping"" system. Still a great game, though.

EDIT: thanks for removing Denuvo, Capcom!",Recommended," August 27, 2019"

There's not much to say aside from calling it a ''spectacular return to form'' for the Resident Evil franchise. I loved RE7 already, but it still felt a bit like Capcom trying to catch a new wave, latching onto a trend instead of picking and modernizing what was right with the older RE games. What made them special and awesome was the combination of all aspects of gameplay and pure vintage cheddar level of cheese. The new Resident Evil 2 has all of that plus more. It's not a remake, it's a complete reimagining of the original for new generation of players and a love letter to the fans. Are there any Back to the Future 3 easter eggs? Nope, but there's plenty of other things to look out for, there's a possible raccoon milking industry before the zombies show up...
It plays great, it looks great and there's enough content to keep it going for a while, not to mention it being an awesome introduction to speedrunning. There is no reason to not pick this up if you're a fan of horror or methodical, slower paced action games. Now, just go.

DISCLAIMER
I have never played a Resident Evil game in my life (prior to this one of course). This includes the original version of Resident Evil 2. This review will not focus on the improvements made on the original version of the game nor will I compare the story or game play to a different resident evil game. I will only talk about my experiences in this game.

THE REVIEW

Resident Evil was a series I had always heard about, but never had the opportunity to try. I had always liked the horror genre, and games are not an exception. I had dabbled in some popular ones such as Amnesia and the like, but none of them really struck a cord with me, until I played this game. This game is the epitome of horror done right. It's graphics are beautiful, it's puzzles are intuitive and immensely satisfying,the environment is beautifully designed, and, the replay-ability is quite high.

I'll get this out of the way now, the story of this game isn't anything special. It's the standard zombie apocalypse scenario. You are thrown into a world filled with zombies and have to find a way to stop it, and find out how it happened. Not a story for the ages, but the game play and characters more than make up for it.

Prior to starting a new save, you have the option of choosing between 2 stories. First one is Leon S Kennedy, a fresh out of the academy cop hired at the Raccoon City Police Department. On the drive to his first day, he noticed zombies walking around, and when he arrived to the Police Department, he found that it was infested by said zombies. The other option is to play as Claire Redfield. She travelled to Raccoon City in search of her brother, Chris, who went missing after the zombie outbreak. Each story shows a different perspective on the same incident, with occasional meet-ups between the 2 characters, tying the story together. Throughout the game the characters are quite emotive when it comes to them getting hurt or reacting to a stressful scenario, which gives the game even more life. The game can also have different outcomes based on the character you play first. I'm not going to tell you what order is the best, because honestly, I don't know. Pick whoever you like more I suppose.

This game's horror isn't the typical horror I had seen in other horror games. Most horror games scare the player through cheap jump scares or have the enemies as the source of the player's fear, in this game however, this isn't the case. The true horror stems from the resource management in the game. Ammo is SCARCE and I mean SCARCE. Zombies take multiple bullets to take down, and with the rarity of ammo in this game, it is easy to tell why it can be terrifying. I had found myself frantically running in the opposite direction when I ran out of ammo hoping I could get out in one piece. This combined with the tight hallways and claustrophobic rooms, the adrenaline rush I got from the fear was truly amazing.

The puzzles are also fantastic, they are (as I aforementioned) immensely satisfying to solve and very fun as well. Many of them force you to explore the area and pick up on clues with documents that were left around. Granted, there is a lot of running around to solve a puzzle (for one puzzle I had to run from one side of the police station to another), but for the first time in a game, I didn't mind it. The atmosphere exudes a very eerie vibe (as it should) even when I knew I had cleared out all the zombies in that area. The fear of the unknown in this game was constantly in the back of my head, so I never truly felt safe. This is why I didn't mind the running, it had my mind preoccupied with survival and not just getting to point B from point A.

The graphics of this game are truly a sight to behold. They are VERY nice to look at. I spent about a minute admiring how detailed a zombie looked after I blasted it's head clean off. That being said, a stronger computer is needed to enjoy this game to it's fullest, but it is definitely worth it.

In conclusion, this game is a master piece. The characters are interesting and emotive, the puzzles and environments are brilliantly designed, and the graphics quite amazing as well. I can confidently say that this game is worth every single penny it is priced at. A must have for any steam library, and any horror fan.",Recommended," July 4, 2019"

Resident Evil 2 / Biohazard RE:2, a.k.a RE:2 Remake. Is it worth the price?

Resident Evil 2 is a Third-Person Shooter made by Capcom and first released in 1998. In 2019, they have remade the game and began selling under the title ""Resident Evil 2 / Biohazard RE:2"". But, is it worth it?

Pros
Impressively great graphics.
Can set the difficulties to make the game a casual weekend game to a Post-Apocalyptic Zombie Survival game.
The mixture of action and horror delivers the players a both beautiful and grotesque game.
A game long enough to take a long time to beat ""completely"".
Optimized game and almost no loading screens.
Considering that in this segment, high-end GPUs are not expensive as before and the game is more pushy to the GPU, most of the current generation computers can run this game smoothly.

Contra
The game can be very hard sometimes, Capcom has forgot to explain the players what to do unless the player dies a lot.
The game must be finished twice in order to be completely beaten, giving the people who hates replaying a pain.


I've bought this game in the summer sales for 30ish Euros and I can say that it is worth it. Not only that it gives the players a long and detailed story, the game can be challenging and demonstrate the greatness of RE Engine. Weapons are great, graphics are great, story is great, mechanics are great and this list would keep going on. For 30 bucks it is worth it, but I don't think if I could pay the full price, since this game is not really as replayable as RPG games or games such as D:BH.
This game is a GPU killer, though. My old and overclocked FX6300 didn't had any trouble, but my GPU was struggling to load the graphics. But after a point, somehow both the GPU and CPU usage was reduced. I guess at first it needs high usage, idk.

Long story short, buy this game during the sales and you won't regret it",Recommended," July 1, 2019"

This is, in almost every way, a perfect game.
Pros:
- Great music: The score, especially on some of the DLC modes, is gorgeous.
- Amazing gameplay: The gameplay is smooth, fun, and nothing feels overly tedious or boring.
- Great replay value: This game should be played at least four times, if not more. It is great for speed running as well.
- All DLC is free: any micro-transactions are relatively cheap cosmetics.
- Very scary: You're gonna crap your pants on the first play through.

This is my 2nd entry for Resident evil franchise my first ever game.

I played the Revelations as my first Resident Evil Revelations as, soon as I heard that they were going to remake the ""OG"" RE:2

I was so hyped about it. So then when it came out I bought it on the PS4 first and, then after playing it on the PS4

I had such a blast playing the game and I've decided to buy the game for steam edition.

What I was really impressed by was How the graphics of this game look fantastic on both PC and PS4.

Character development was also what I find great about this game each, character has their own unique background and as well as the progressing of the story.

One complaints about this game they should've make the B scenario better than the A scenario.

Should I recommend this game?
Yes. why?

The Graphics are 10/10
Story progress 10/10
Puzzle 10/10
Chemistry between Characters 10/10

Basically over all 10/10

Better than RE7 in my opinion",Recommended," June 12, 2019"

A true Masterpiece from Capcom . i finished the whole leon's first scenario in 1 non-stop playthrough , just could not stand of the chair just to let you know how great and polished this game is and it's a must buy for the old RE fans and the new . if Devil may cry 5 is my GOTY2019 then this game has no competition of the 2nd place .

At first when fixed camera angles were not shown and a third person over the shoulder style was announced instead I was genuinely disappointed. Being the REmake of my all time favorite game though I was automatically compelled to give it a shot. So to finally see what Capcom was delivering in terms of a REmake 2 was definitely something I was begrudgingly willing to accept. I've been a fan of this series and this game particularly for a very long time. I remember the days of old when just DAYS after the original RE 1 REmake people were already discussing what RE2 REmake would be like. And now, here it is, it's real and you can buy it today. And you should.

Because it's FREAKING INCREDIBLE. Does Capcom manage to pull off what would normally feel like a typical third person action shooter and instead create a really immersive, horrific, tension filled atmosphere with game play and controls that mimic the originals brutal and unforgiving system? Yes. Do they add a few new twists and quality of life improvements made to better reflect the game's contemporary audience? You better believe it. It's a survival horror game through and through. Running through the campaigns each time to get all 4 S+ ranks was both a difficult and immensely rewarding experience. It reminded me of doing it in the old days when I was a kid. There is a refinement in the gameplay as years of iteration and tweaking of the formula Capcom helped to establish can be felt in every aspect of the game. It's very satisfying to say the least and above all else the RE 2 REmake FEELS like a true RE title.

Capcom is here to stay and has definitely made an impression on a fan who up until RE 7 was just about done with the series in the modern age and would find myself almost exclusively playing the older titles. However, I think I'll be playing this version for many more hours to come. Buy it. Worth every penny especially if it's on sale.

Having never played the original RE:2 but having played RE:7 as well as RE:HD I can safely say this game holds the terror I experienced on the previous titles. Where RE:7 threw flame rounds and burner fuel at me left and right, RE:2 is what it truly means to manage your ammo and plan your escapes and routes ahead of time. I am only past the first boss fought but after encountering the dog kennel section it is safe to say that even the most hardened of manly men will jump and let out the occasional yelp. Great game but I cannot speak for if it stays true to it's original but watching videos and seeing these designs upgraded is amazing.

For performance I can stay solid 72fps on high settings with an RX 580 4GB OC'd to 1400Mhz and an R5 2600 at 4.0ghz",Recommended," February 23, 2019"

A Masterpiece of a Remake

The Resident Evil series has had its share of ups and downs over the decades, but it certainly can't be accused of ever stagnating. The franchise has experimented with different controls, structures and tones and spawned many different fan camps as a result. Yet no single entry has ever managed to spark interest with all of those camps. This new Resident Evil 2 may be the exception.

Resident Evil 2 is a remake of the 1998 PlayStation 1 classic of the same name. As such, it of course shares the same premise and setting with the survival horror giant of yore. While the infamous T-Virus is spreading throughout Raccoon City, reanimating one corpse after another, Claire Redfield and Leon Kennedy find themselves trapped in a police department that serves as the game's equivalent to the first Resident Evil's Spencer Mansion. While the purpose of the story consists mainly in propelling the gameplay and establishing context for the undead creatures that have taken over, the improved dialogue and voice acting add a great deal of authenticity to this zombie apocalypse. The goofy caricatures of the original Resident Evil 2 are replaced with characters that are written, performed and animated so believably that the entire tone of the game feels darker and more serious as a result. The technology and art behind the series have finally caught up with the vision it's had since its conception.

The game is not just tonally dark but also visually. The comforting rays of the flashlight are crucial when tip-toeing around the police station's grimy and bloody corridors. Careless players will no doubt find themselves ambushed by more than one shadowclad foe. But audio cues help a lot with staying at the ready. Aside from some unremarkable weapon sounds, the audio design in Resident Evil 2 is nothing short of stellar. One particular enemy's terrifying trademark footsteps are already iconic and a great example of how acoustics can add to immersion. The music stays hidden for much of the game, adding just subtle accents here and there to reminisce about the original Resident Evil 2. Yet the soundtrack also knows how to emphasize the action whenever needed. This new version of the game is one of the scariest series entries to date ‚Äì rivalled only by Resident Evil 7 and the 2002 remake. It's without question the goriest of the bunch, however. Exposed internal organs are displayed with incredible detail and paced just infrequently enough to never truly desensitize the player to them. The game, as a whole, features phenomenal visuals. Between the realistic facial features, the organic animations and the jaw-dropping fire effects, there's a lot of eye candy to behold in Resident Evil 2. The survival horror illusion only cracks in rare instances when zombies stop giving chase due to invisible walls they can't pass or when the physics for an enemy carry on happily even after its demise.

Capcom's latest effort does a great job in recreating the Raccoon City Police Department ‚Äì not just conceptually, but also structurally. The game's environments are anything but linear. Different sections are intertwined horizontally and vertically in numerous ways, virtually creating entire labyrinths for Leon and Claire to navigate through. However, they're not the kinds of labyrinths the player gets stuck in for hours. There are always subtle nudges pointing the character to the next point of interest, making for a consistent pace governed by exploration and discovery. In terms of progression, the game is a classic Resident Evil through and through ‚Äì hearkening back to the Metroidvania-type structure the franchise was known for until its fourth instalment changed the formula.

However, the new Resident Evil 2 doesn't share the control scheme of the original template. Contrary to popular belief, fixed camera angles and traditional tank controls are a great combination even today. But it's true that many, if not most, gamers nowadays are not very familiar with that type of experience. Knowing that, Capcom have recreated this horror classic with a much more commonplace third-person perspective akin to some of the newer Resident Evil games such as 6 or Revelations 2. While many die-hard fans of the franchise undoubtedly miss the controls, the new method works just as well, and even though it's not necessarily a better alternative, it is a more modern approach that's able to resonate with more players ‚Äì making the game ultimately more accessible. Leon and Claire can now even shoot while moving. Mind-blowing, right? The developers have created a perfect blend of the classic Resident Evil map structures and progression style on one hand and the more modern controls and camera perspectives on the other.

Like in the original, the story mode in Resident Evil 2 is split into four different scenarios ‚Äì two per character. While Leon's and Claire's playhtroughs differ quite substantially from one another in certain sections, the scenarios that share the same player character are almost identical. This is where Capcom could have expanded the plot a little and maybe delve more into the backstories of other characters, for example. As it stands though, it's not worth playing through all four campaigns. Just one playthrough per character essentially tells the whole story over a combined playtime of around 14 to 18 hours casually. Players who really want to challenge themselves can play the game on the hardcore difficulty. This setting features much stronger enemies and requires the player to use ink ribbons, of which there are a limited quantity, in order to save ‚Äì a callback to the classic Resident Evil games, albeit much more challenging than any of them. In addition to all of that, Resident Evil 2 also includes some unlockable bonus modes that are more heavily focused on delivering fast-paced action but maintain the importance of clever resource management. The game offers plenty of content, and that's without even mentioning its free DLC.

2019's Resident Evil 2 is a remake done right. The original is a great survival horror game even today, but the new version improves on it in nearly every aspect. It's darker, scarier, more accessible and more tonally consistent. It's also a treat for the eyes and plays fantastically. While little hiccups can sometimes break the immersion and the second scenarios don't fully capitalize on their potential, the amount of polish and thought that has gone into the game more than makes up for it. This remake marks the first time Capcom have truly mastered their blend of old and new. It perfectly modernizes the 1998 classic without betraying its roots and in many ways feels like the game RE4 tried to be back in 2005. Resident Evil 2 is not just one of the best Resident Evil entries ever made, but also one of the best survival horror games to date ‚Äì a true masterpiece of a remake.",Recommended," February 21, 2019"

Quick summary: one of the best games of 2019 and of the 2010's.

Capcom just showed how a remake should be made. Still keeping the feeling that you are playing the game from 1998 but with lots of things reimagined, making it better and making the atmosphere scarier. All the things have changed to make it more tense like the first Licker encounter won't happen so fast and Mr. X from B-side of the original is now in all of the campaigns. Mr. X is one of the best and also the most annoying thing in this game. Mr. X makes your heart race and also when you think you're safe he will come and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you up. You have to make a decision, kill the zombies so you can run around freely and lose him easily all save ammo, just keep escaping and hiding. You will learn his patterns when you die a few times.

Many of the people were scared that the removal of static camera angles would ruin the horror but the over-the-shoulder perspective is actually much more tense in this game than any other RE games with the same perspective. Gameplay is pretty much perfect and gives you the ""tanky"" RE control feels. Puzzles are back and some are harder than the others. I love that the puzzles make you backtrack around the Police Station, Sewers etc. Keeping the old school feel of video games that not everything is streamlined. RE2 features a variety of guns and all the classics from 1998 too.

Graphics? My god they are gorgeous. RE Engine is one of the best engines to date. I hope Capcom keeps improving it and making it better. Everything is properly optimized and beautiful. Motion capture is state of the art and lip syncing. RE2 looks beautiful in all levels. Low to Extreme, that's rare for a modern game. Audio side is a totally new technology made for the RE Engine giving it full 360 degrees and I ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• myself a few times because of the audio, actually felt like someone was next to me. Headset? Prepare to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• your pants. Speakers also too if you have good ones.

Story has been altered but also making it faithful to the original, taking bits from there and moving them to different parts of the game. Trust me, almost everything you remember from the original is there, just in different scenarios of the game making it more complete.

Resident Evil 2 is the best game and easily can say, the BEST GAME to come out in years. It's perfect in my opinion. Totally worth the wait and the money. You can get 50-60 of gameplay from this game easily if you want to unlock everything, play the 2nd run, play the B runs and also unlock everything (you need hardcore S ranks for etc. the infinite MP5).

I've just started on my 2nd run (but not really first run with Claire!) And enjoying it once again! I -HIGHLY- suggest playing with headphones and the 3d audio it gives amazing atmosphere and made it so much spookier for me! As a lover of all things horror movies and games I say go for it!

I loved the original trilogy. It wouldn't be a far cry to say that the first four entries of this series made me into a man of caliber. I spent many hours try-harding in those games until I finally blossomed into the Nemesis-man-fighting, knife wielding, battle hardened nerd veteran that I am today.

With that being said, I'll admit I was not excited at all when I read about this remake. In my humblest of opinions the games have descended in quality since RE4, and have ranged from anywhere between ""meh"", to ""literal crime against humanity"". Logically, I figured this remake represented as a very real attack on my person, and would only serve to disappoint me; thereby ruining my childhood and life entirely. It wasn't worth the risk.

A slew of positive reviews convinced me to peek back into the remake, and even dare to dream that it would not resemble the hot pile of miserable garbage that many of it's more modern predecessors did. After viewing the communities collective engorgement, It felt irresponsible to not purchase this game. I threw my pathetic reasoning into the trash can beside my responsiblities and positive memories from my childhood, and bought this game at full price.

This game kicks ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Bigtime. My preconceptions where so horribly wrong. Because of that, my childhood is vindicated instead of ruined, and I can finally stop crying myself to sleep at night. Do 3 next.",Recommended," February 11, 2019"

Yeah uh I think this is a good game.

But in all seriousness this game was a fantastic way to kick off 2019. True horror survival returns with RE2make and Capcom captures what made Resident Evil the franchise it is in a modern reimagining of the all time classic. The gameplay is tight and imo true over the shoulder done right for this game while still retaining the classic quirks and staple gameplay elements of classic RE like inventory management and unlimited inventory boxes where your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• that you dropped off in one box just teleports to another identical box in an area miles away form where you originally stashed your items. The sound design is also one of the best I've heard for a game and helps amplify your surroundings to give it that sensation of being scared when you hear Mr. X's footsteps in the hallway adjacent to your location. The story itself is a reimagining of the original RE2 story in where some cases some sacrifices were made but where also it expanded on some other elements in RE lore and overall still delivers and exciting story to enjoy. The strongest suit of this honestly is not that it's a classic reimagined for modern day gameplay, but possibly the amount of replayabilty this game has. You can beat each campaign in roughly 6-8 hours depending on your skill level but also being able to enjoy the enviroments and story, but you can always come back to beat the game and get it done in under 1:30 to 2:30 hours once you know how to work the game in your favor and remembering specific routes to take.

Overall this game is super enjoyable, definitely worth MSRP and even the deluxe edition you enjoy dressing up and I HIGHLY recommend replaying this game with the OG soundtrack and SFX elements on.

A solid 9/10",Recommended," February 10, 2019"

Capcom makes a comeback with one of its greatest survival horror games. I never played the original Resident Evil 2 on the PS1 but I read online that it was one of the most famous video games of all time. Playing the remake, history has definitely repeated itself this time around.

The game is intense and difficult making confrontation with enemies tense and nerve wracking. Items and resources are scarce and the player has to decide on whether to engage them or run from them making it a strategic fight or flight experience. The police department which forms 60% of the main game is a labyrinth to explore but thanks to the engaging map design it makes for an easy exploration. There are puzzle which require key items to solve which are scattered throughout the game map which make for a lot of backtracking to areas already visited which makes you plan your approach with caution due to the presence of zombies everywhere. The game creates a perfect balance between exploration and rewards making the player getting unique items which help them in combat. Hence, the game is not meant to be rushed through but played at its own pace slowly uncovering its secrets. Exploration rewards the players with powerful weapons, powerful ammo types and necessary upgrades to improve your existing weapons. The encounters with zombies are intense and some of the boss fights can be pretty challenging if you have not managed your resource items well. It hits the all the right tones of survival horror making you feel vulnerable and alone and keeps the players on his/her toes the whole time.

One minor gripe which people may have with this game is lack of coherence between the scenarios of the two playable characters in the game, Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield. You can play the game as any one of them and the story of the 2nd character is supposed to run parallel to the one you are playing. This is not the case however, when you finish the game with the 1st character and start another playthrough with the second one, the plot does not intersect and its basically the same story with a different weapon loadout and different items scattered throughout. However, there are some unique areas and also 2 additional boss fights in the 2nd scenario and also you get to unlock the ""true ending"" of the game. Personally, i didn't find it much of a problem but many people can be ticked off by it. The ideal playthrough according to me would be to start the new game with one character and then do a second run with the other character.

The game is greatly optimized and ran at a constant 60 Fps for me with zero issues. The visuals are great and the lighting and shadows truly create a claustrophobic environment. The character models are done well and the enemy designs are superb and scary. The sound quality is top notch, make sure to turn on the ""Binaural"" option in the in game sound settings and play with headphones for an intense experience.

A bold and welcome step by Capcom to bring back the survival horror to its full glory back to the gaming community. Fans of the original game, horror fans as well as Resident Evil fans, Capcom has everything for everyone of them this time around and we hope to see a remake of Resident Evil 3 soon. We need these types of games in an oversaturated market where most horror games make you feel invincible like Rambo killing your enemies.",Recommended," February 9, 2019"

No complaint here.. Poteltial SPoilers read at your own risk****

The Game runs flawless on my system constant 60gps prob could do more if my monitor could handle it.

The only complaint is that the story at first seems changed a bit



Graphics: AMAZING unless you running a potatoe
Sound: You WILL ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• yourself....headphones 7.1 is the only way to play trust me...
Gameplay: well this might not be for everyone i'm suprised no one ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed about it...we did when we heard but the 3rd Person kinda worked well in this game cause it kept its horror.. i do wish that i could change shoulders or something...kinda difficult in some angles... Ammo is scarce which is great for a survival horror...just in HARDCORE mode i think they eat too much bullets to the head

Hardcore mode: kinda overkill but this begs to be for people with a stratergy cause its only fair to say its a awesome mode but if you know what you doing cause you could save and then bam you actually saved a stuff up.

animations and acting.. omg excellent its been a while since i have enjoyed something this high in quality even more so than RE7 to be honest.

overall im loving the game.. played Leon A currently with Claire B should be fun.

spent way too many hours exploring the game but i loved it its been a while since ive enjoyed a good game it did not get boring at all even when you die like 5-10 times in a row

was little disapointed in some of the weapons.
The Bonus Weapons from Pre-order you cant upgrade them..they suck

the shotgun...the upgrade isnt so much worthy like the orignal there is no kick back and the zombies heads are harder to pop than the original... kinda disapointed in that department.

zombie attack... there is no mashing anything to get you out of that ordeal which kinda sucks they went with the whole RE1 remake mechanic with the knives.. kinda annoying when you saving the knive for later.

Spiders? k could be a Leon A thing but no spiders?


Weapons 2: i have been reading around but doesnt seem like there is a challenge to win/gain infinite weapons ammo for lets say Rockets or Gataling gun... that i hope is not the case cause when in the original we had Rocket launcher unlocked it was most fun blasting everything away to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.

This game is not only great on its own it has also the most optimized and customizable graphics in any AAA game you have ever seen. It just works perfectly, looks neat, my FPS is high even on Ultra settings and I have only a modest GTX 970. When I play 4K it drops to 30-15 fps but it is still rather playable.

Capcom managed to deliver an example of how a remake should be made. I wish this game had first-person mode and Brazilian Portuguese for audio as well but other than that this game is just my favorite game of 2019 already.

Probably the best remake ever made. I loved the original, and this one did not disappoint. It managed to keep the atmosphere and horror feeling while still applying modern gaming features. I highly recommend, especially to lovers of the original RE2. Well done, CAPCOM!",Recommended," February 4, 2019"

This is easily my GOTY of 2019.

What Capcom has made is some of the most intense, most refreshing take on the best PS1 Resident Evil, and I'm so glad I gave it a chance, despite never considering myself a RE fan. I don't usually replay my games too much either, but this one, I think i'll have a few more playthroughs this year.

Also, I can't wait for those extra DLCs in the coming month.",Recommended," February 3, 2019"

Loved the game, been playing it since release and it got me glued to the monitor all day long.

Summary of the game itself

I've been waiting for this game for a very long time and since they announced they are working on this I waited years till it is finally out. This game has been an amazing adventure and worth all the hours I put in within the short time. Resident Evil 2 2018 is based on the original Resident Evil 2 which came out in 1998 and has become modernized with it graphics, game play, and design. There are many nods to the original especially during the opening and with a few confrontations with certain characters. You still recieve both A and B scenarios from the original however it is titled ""Second run"". They have also added new parts to the game where you get to play as Sherry Birkin! I do believe I got my money's worth especially for the deluxe edition and for its price range is more than fair for what you get. It is also very well optimized with its RE Engine working well even on a 1060!



- 3 costumes for Claire

- 2 costumes for Leon

- DLC Pistol(s)

- Retro Soundtrack swap for the original Re2



The deluxe edition of this game is not pricey by any means and is just 10 dollars more than the original version at 70 dollars rather than 60. If you are interested in cosmetics then I would say it's worth it especially for the soundtrack swap which brings back a lot of nostalgia for those who originally played the 1998 version. However, if you do not want to then you still get some costumes even if you by the original! You will receive Leon's 1998 outfit after beating Claire's campaign for the first time and receive Claire's costume by beating Leon's campaign for the first time and there are extra versions of those by beating hardcore mode with an S rank and above!



There are 4 campaigns however 2 are distinctly different while the other 2 seem to just be the same but playing as the other protagonist. The difference would be playing a new game and then doing a second run (B scenario). After completing these campaigns you will also receive the 4th Survivor mode where you play as Hunk! If you also beat this mode you will unlock Tofu which is a comedic version of 4th Survivor which is much harder and Tofu has 5 versions that you can unlock! If you are a Completionist and like to do everything and unlock everything there are plenty of things to do as well as challenges to unlock special weapons! If you are just a casual gamer I'd still say there is plenty to do if you would like to do everything once and it is still fun to replay if you like to. They're are also adding free content on February 15th which will add short stories of playing characters you learn about within the game and some you will learn more about! It will also contain a more HD version of Polygonized Leon and Claire from the 1998 version as costumes.



Resident Evil 2 Remake is a beautiful recreation of its 1998 predecessor with lots of content even if you are just casually playing there is still plenty to do after with bonus modes and new content coming February 15th. Very well optimized due to their RE Engine being great for this game. Graphics are stunning with it. If you want costumes its entirely up to you it is just 10 dollars more and it also comes with a 1998 soundtrack swap you can use. You still get the 1998 costumes by just beating both campaigns and free polygon versions of them coming on the 15th of February if you want to get costumes but not buy the Deluxe package.",Recommended," February 2, 2019"

Resident Evil 2 might very well be the best remake I have played in my entire life. I dare to say it's even superior to the Resident Evil 1 Remake.
Not only did they perfectly recapture the atmosphere and the soul of the original game, they actually greatly improved on it. This game is an immaculately crafted, gorgeous looking and absolutely riveting love letter to all Resident Evil fans, and lovers of the survival horror genre.
I've only finished Claire A so far, and yet, I still feel like I've only just begun, especially considering the 4 main story lines (Claire A+Leon B/Leon A+Claire B) and all the bonus content coming out in the near future. Capcom really put in the work with this one, and I can't wait to see what they will come up with next. Hopefully a RE3 remake and maybe a RE8?

Resident Evil 2 is arguably my favourite in the series now, replacing Resident Evil 4 by just a smidgen, Capcom has yet again struck gold with this Entry of the series.

Let's talk about a few Pros and cons, this review will be edited/added onto as I get time to restructure, for now, it'll be a few pros and cons

Pros:
-Atmosphere is amazing, near perfect, always kept on my toes throughout the entire game
-Gunplay has struck a balance between new and old, allowing you to shoot on the move, but punishing it via lessened accuracy.
-The story feels believable in that, the amount of shots it takes to really kill a zombie would explain how the RPD got overrun even with armed Police Officers.
-The new VA and Facial capture, while it has a few hitches is really good, and obviously a massive upgrade to the original
-The overall Station layout has some tweaks and changes, but remains for the most part the same station we know and love. playing homage to the original RPD.
-Leon's Alternative Costume is a nice homage to the original as well, keeping his bulky shoulderpads.
-Zombies fall apart in glorious ways when blasted with shotguns and magnums
-Hardcore is extremely difficult
-Free DLC on the way, including 3 new small ""What if"" stories as well as 1998 Costumes for Leon and Claire in all their low Poly glory
-Ammo and health management important like the original
-No more Fixed Camera angles (Can be a con for some purists, so leave this where you will in your personal opinion)
-Mr. X is an amazing mechanic
-He also has a hat.
-Claire's Alternative costume is lacking her old black sleeves, it feels off because of this.
-Adaptive Difficulty feels like a very bad choice for a game which offers rewards for speedrunning, as inconsistency is a big detriment to the concept of speedrunning, it is hard to plan for moments when sometimes it takes 1 shot to stagger a zombie, and others it takes 5 or 6.
-This also makes Hardcore mode feel fair in difficulty sometimes, and others, it feels off because of just how many more shots you're wasting on a single zombie each run.
-Mr. X doesn't pick the hat up if you shoot it off :(
-B Scenarios are not that different from the A scenarios, including some story segments such as say... a character dying, happening in 2 different places, meaning they don't actually fit into the canon.
-After completing the game, I do wish Mercenaries existed in this game, perhaps in a DLC or RE3make


Overall? Resident Evil 2 is an amazing Reimagining of the original 1998 Classic, and I heavily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good Horror Experience, as well as Oldschool Resident Evil fans",Recommended," January 31, 2019"

20 years ago, I went to my grandma's house on Mother's Day and my uncle called me over to his room and introduced me to the PlayStation. The first game I saw was of course Resident Evil 2. Never played the first and I heard it was good, but i heard the 2nd was scary. I showed him the game and he put it in and I was so excited. Until I pushed the start button and that voice came. My excitement turned to nervousness and soon turned to fear as I played it. My stomach churned as I sank back in the couch hearing that first scene music and the zombies moaning right when you start. Of course, I didn‚Äôt know how to work the controls and I watched Leon get eaten by the zombies. I was so traumatized by the game, that I never touched RE until the 2nd and 3rd came for GameCube followed by the 1st remake. Now we get the redone, reimagined Resident Evil 2 and there are some hits and misses in the game but overall, I liked it.

Now I'm now one to talk about graphics in video games, but this one I must. Everything was so brilliant, the details of the characters, the animations of both them and the zombies, the details of where you shoot the zombies, watching their arms and legs fall off, their heads popping when you get that critical shot in. The lighting was so awesome like the press conference room where you turn on the light and when you close the door, you see the light coming from the bullet holes on the door. William Birkin's 1st form was so detailed and seeing the veins and stuff popping from him and the eye blinking was superb and was one of my most favorite fights. The blood details coming off Leon/Clair when you take damage from zombies/dogs/lickers and seeing the bite/claw marks and seeing Claire and Leon wincing in pain the looks on their faces when you're on caution or danger. I could go on talking about the graphics all day if I must, but overall the graphics of course blows the classic version out of the water.

Everybody knows the story of RE2 so don‚Äôt need to get to that but the story telling and dramatization for this game was awesome. I loved how they gave some of the minor characters more screen time like Marvin Branagh, Chief Irons, but not enough screen time for Ben Bertolucci. I didn‚Äôt like how Ben just died so fast and how they didn‚Äôt throw the options of him being killed by Mr. X or William like in the classic. As a matter of fact, in the classic, he wanted to stay in his cell because of the dangers in the police station as in this one he wants out. I loved how they did Marvin as you watched him slowly turn into a zombie, but it lacked a cutscene which is a huge sin in Resident Evil since he was an important character. I love how they added a new perspective of Chief Irons as this crazed character, but I think the classic did Irons better as he started off completely normal and had the body of the Mayor's daughter and he cried on how he failed to protect her. But later on, in the classic, you take his journal and learn that not only did he work for umbrella, but he was sabotaging the police department by taking ammo and slowly hunting other police officers and eventually hunted and killed the mayor's daughter, which bought that suspense in the classic version. I loved how they did Ada as this cold, heartless mercenary who was using Leon but soon started to have feelings for him. Sherry wasn't as annoying as the classic, so I'll give them that. And finally, William Birkin's 3rd form. The best boss fight in the entire game. And that nostalgic opera shout in the beginning along with the roar of the 3rd form was perfect. It got my adrenaline pumping as I gathered all the ammo...but then realized I had the magnum on Leon/upgraded HP bullets on Claire and shot him down. And finally, Mr. X. Hands down, he is better than the classic version, I can‚Äôt lie on that part. Him being this bullet proof, unstoppable terminator along with that theme music had me on edge. And he didn‚Äôt stop chasing me. Best part was when I you lose him, and you can hear the heavy footsteps. Best part of it was that whenever you used a weapon, he would hear it and come to the room where he last heard it. But, like the licker, he lacked a intro cutscene. In the classic, you can see that he was airdropped by umbrella. Here, he just appears without a back story behind him or little to no lore on him. Other than the minuses, I still loved it.

The misses of this game. First, the title screen. There was no voice saying the name of the game in that eerie horrifying voice and I don‚Äôt understand how Capcom could miss that iconic moment. Another is the intro. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I loved the new intro and how it started, but they didn‚Äôt give a back story as to what happened for newcomers that want to play Resident Evil. Another is the lack of background lore. In the classic there were notes containing of what happened after the mansion incident and during the first few days of the T-Virus spreading. I recall one journal from a cop explaining how he was playing chess with another man and how the man was slowly starting to become infected and slowly explained date by date on how the man's health was deteriorating and eventually leading the cop not feeling too well, either. There was lack of lore of the Licker and why it was named for it. I know why I know its name, but for those who are new to RE, they would want to know. The S.T.A.R.S room was empty. In the classic version, it explained whose desk it was and the pictures along with the trophies explaining that Chris Redfield won them for best marksman ship. Not only that, it explained the behavior of those who sat in those desks. Like Wesker‚Äôs desk was explained as neat and organized while Barry's had replica guns and books stating that he could be from the N.R.A. Rebecca's was all clean indicating that she was new to the team. None of that was there. And there was no fax coming from the US feds indicating and explaining that Chris was still investigating and how Chief Irons needed to be watched very carefully and how he was paid by umbrella to cover up the mansion case. Here it‚Äôs some coded letter stating that he was in Europe and how William Birkin was paying him instead of Umbrella. I liked the new approach but there should've been more detail on how messed up Chief Irons is. He doesn‚Äôt even explain on hunting and killing the Mayor's daughter. It just says pig and how he loved the white skin on it. I mean for us who played the classic we knew what he was talking about, but the newcomers probably didn‚Äôt until they got to sherry's story.

Finally, the biggest miss in the entire game: The B scenarios. I was so excited to play the B scenario when I beat the A and was thinking it would be different. It wasn't at all. Once you got past that first door, everything just repeated except that the key items were placed in different areas and the puzzles changed. And Mr. X came earlier that was it. Also, there was no interactions between Claire meeting with Ada or Leon meeting with Sherry. Along with Claire or Leon meeting face to face or interacting with each other until like the end of the game. I mean realistically, you would be worried about the other survivor that you met and hope he/she would be alright. Does Leon/Claire do that? No, they just go their own way until they see each other in the lab and are like, ""Wait you are down here, too?!"" Also, where are the crows and the spiders? Sure, the G-adults were a welcoming addition, but it‚Äôs not RE without giant insects and crows.

Overall the game is great as I said with the graphics and dramatization of the story, it succeeds in some places over the classic, but also lacks in some areas the classic had. Hopefully that can be improved when Capcom works on Resident Evil 3.",Recommended," January 31, 2019"

188man Reviews Resident Evil 2 (2019)

-Spoiler free review--

I will preface my review by saying that I have completed the first scenario with leon on hardcore difficulty and I'm playing Claire's B campaign now on standard.

--UPDATE: 2/1/2019 - I've completed both scenarios, I've also updated the review in general.

--Positive--

First of all, I was a huge fan of the original game as well as the other golden age era Resident Evil titles such as Resident evil 1 and 3. I played the franchise from it's conception and for the longest time I was more or less devoid of any hope for this series returning to greatness. I can safely say that my prayers have been answered, this game is excellent and is mostly faithful to the original.

Make no mistake this is Resident evil 2 despite having a RE4 style camera view and aiming mechanic, which I might add at first was a disappointment for I being probably the biggest advocate of the fixed camera angles and controls. The essence is intact with even the same signature rhythm of gameplay that the older entries are renowned for. The scares are still there, albeit in very different places compared to the original, which makes going through this title even more jarring, even if you're a veteran of survival horror games.
Survival tactics and strategy has returned yet again and is in full force, you have to plan ahead for most engagements if you want to survive. Provisions are low in this game so you'll have to conserve and only attack when you must otherwise you'll be faced with a very hard game indeed.

The puzzles have come back in style and are a nice addition to the game, although if you're not aware of how many challenges their are, you might get frustrated. Personally I love puzzles It's not a problem for me, it's what I come to expect playing many survival horror games. I like what they did with the creatures in this game, they're very aggressive and tough, even your lowly zombie is a much greater threat in this game compared to the original iteration, so be advised.

The Tyrant aka Mr. X who was the hulking trench coat wearing terminator type character who stalked you through Resident Evil 2 B scenario, makes a come back and is also enhanced. This monster follows you almost everywhere this time and is a far deadlier opponent compared to the original beast, which really does remind me of Nemesis from Resident Evil 3. The environments are richly detailed and are full of dread with a bespoke frightening quality, luckily there is a good variety of places to venture, seeing that backtracking and exploration is a major part of this game.

Their are no loading screens in this game besides the one that starts the new game, which is amazing seeing how big this game is. This helps the experience immensely, I'm very impressed. The graphics are very nice although not the best I've seen but very good nonetheless, it's not an issue with me, however you might want to upgrade your PC if I were you.

The controls handle very nicely considering I'm using a mouse and keyboard. By default you have the WASD keys for movement with space and auxiliary buttons like E and F for other tasks. The mouse is used for most interactions as well as shooting, it's very easy to grasp and master, soon enough you'll be zipping around the police station and shooting like a gunslinger. If you use the controller it's probably easier, both options are equally good.

To end the positive aspects I'll touch on the fact this game is best played on 'hardcore' difficulty being the hardest settings and considering the nature of the game, it's my preferred setting.

--Negative--

Their are small grievances, first of all you'll understand quickly when you play it, it's not a case of difference that might concern you, it's primarily what the developers replaced or taken out completely. Some creatures have been affected by this issue, please be aware of that. Environments that were present in the original game are no longer there, also the 'zap system' has been removed.

Some cut scenes from the first iteration are not here and the direction of the scenes in general lack that iconic flair that the original game had. Voice acting however crude and campy it was in the original entry, is redone here but again lacks that memorable cheese that the original game featured so very well, although that might be down to personal preference.

--Overall--

What we have here is probably the best Resident Evil title in many years and I hope future titles will be as good if not better, we can all hope. Bring on Resident evil 3 capcom!

928,Tha Unicorn God,"
A glorious reimagining of the original game that caters both to contemporary and nostalgic audiences. Capcom's fantastic RE7 engine is put to good use in the 3rd person, and it's hard to fault anything about the production whatsoever.

The beauty of having two campaigns means you can play through on both standard, and hardcore modes (the latter of which is the original Resident Evil format of no autosaving and finite ink-ribbons for typewriters). There are benefits to be had from both modes - standard involves less faff and is arguably more 'fun', but hardcore breeds a tension and forces the measured style of play that made RE2 so iconic.

There's nothing to dislike about this game. It usually isn't a compliment when I say a game is a 'catch-all' but this adaptation is the perfect compilation of old and new, with a massive graphics options screen and the freedom to play the game as faithfully to the original or as streamlined as you like.

And absolute, 100% buy.",Recommended," January 30, 2019"

I never had the chance to play a lot of the old Resident Evil games as I never had the systems they were released on, so all of my exposure of the old titles are through these remakes.

That said, I believe this is probably one of the best 'zombie games' ever made. It definitely has the best zombies I've ever experienced in a game, constantly a little off balance, small bursts of speed when they're close, always menacing you through boarded up windows. The way they move and interact with eachother, especially when falling, is extremely satisfying. Watching zombies trip over their fallen hordemates will never get old.

The other enemies in the game are fantastic as well but I hesitate to go into them in case anyone who doesn't know much about Resident Evil reads this review.

The story feels more grounded than many other Resident Evil titles. That's not to say it's a grounded story, just on a scale of 1-10 of the crazyness, it's been brought down from a series-average 9 to about a 5.

With two distinct runthroughs of the game, a couple neat extra modes, a bunch of unlockables and free DLC coming in the near future, It's a pretty solid package.

My only gripe is that while the new voice actors are very good, I still wish we had Matthew Mercer and Alyson Court back as Leon and Claire respectively.",Recommended," January 29, 2019"

I pre-ordered RE2 just 2 months after it was announced at E3 and without second thinking, all this just to support Capcom in order to get more releases like RE2. (the game is so****good)

Things i liked:
- Very good optimization with so many settings (best settings i have ever seen in any game).
- The feel about the Original version is there + adding and changing things that made it even better.
- the ability to switch between old and new soundtracks (deluxe edition) that feel when you experience the game with the old music so****amazing.
- That feel when you solve a puzzle you have been thinking about it for a while (really good puzzles).
- the design of the 4 main characters feels more realistic and really nice (Leon, Ada, Clair & Sherry).

so many things more that made this '' THE BEST GAME I PLAYED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE ''

Things i didn't like:
- NONE (Ofc)

Things i wish to come later:
- A mode like mercenaries where i can play as any character i like.

I've completed this game on the PS4 Pro and now I've made my way to PC. Yes thats right I brought it twice, thats just how good this game is. If you love survival horror that keeps you on the edge of your seat than look no further, I dont usually frighten that easily in horror games but this Resident Evil 2 Remake kept my heart racing from start to finish. The flesh that comes off the zombies is amazingly detailed, never seen such a thing before with the face slowly ripping apart with every bullet I lodged into the flesh eaters face. The game is very well detailed and polished like anything, so far I haven't encountered any bugs or optimisation issues so right now I'd give Resident Evil 2 a 10/10

I just love the idiocy on the steam reviews from the people down voting this game, first of all it is a really great game as it was built from the ground up so certain things may be different thats why its called REMAKE, i never played the original game myself and i found it a blast to play, from the negative reviews ive seen, people thinks its like RE5 or RE6 where there was no horror elements at all and tried to be call of duty or whatever. No you actually have to turn your brain on, and actually think of what your going to do next, if you use up all your supplies when you first get them your going to run out very fast but thats really part of the strategy, do you go for the kill or do you run by? thats the whole fun about the game is the challenge and people fail to see its about that, you dont run and gun your way through, and thats why i do love it because it really does make you think of which way to go and which routes to take. Mr X/tyrant Can be infurating especially on the harder difficulties, but you have to learn to adapt around him, its called survival horror for a reason and this game really does deserve to be one of the GOTY's already because i can tell capcom put so much effort and love into this remake. Im not gonna give a stupid number but i'd say it certainly is worth your time if you actually want to think",Recommended," January 28, 2019"

I've always maintained the opinion that the Resident Evil remake for GameCube was the best remake of any game ever. Now I have to add ""until January 25th, 2019."" to the end of that statement.

Resident Evil 2 was always my favorite game in the series and I was heartbroken back in 2002/2003 when Capcom scrapped the idea of also remaking RE2 and RE3 and simply ported them instead.

It's been a long time since I've paid full price for a game on Steam and even been excited about a game's release date, but I bought this game on day one and even paid for the Deluxe Edition and I don't regret it one bit. This is the game I'd been waiting for for the past 17 years, and it's better than anything I could've hoped for, they nailed it. I've played the original RE2 many times over but this is just like playing RE2 for the first time, again; exactly the same way I felt about the first remake back in 2002.

Here's to hoping they give RE3 this same treatment.",Recommended," January 28, 2019"

EDITED: Leon A Claire B scenarios

I wanted to add something that I feel has emerged; the more I play the game, the less I feel impressed by it. Maybe I'm just too old and I love REmake so much... I have no idea. I like the concept, I like the design choices and the main threats, I like the limited ammo and strong enemies, but... although the architecture is there, the atmosphere is kinda there... I dont know, I am torn between calling this a great game but not a perfect RE2 by any means, and say it's a ""bad"" remake and a good game on its own. Beside what I'm describing below, I also feel like there is much unnecessary swearing, some plot points have been changed way too much and the interactions between Leon and Claire have been drastically reduced, and the flow of the story simply doesnt satisfy like the original. Reading a memo instead of meeting Leon in person like in the original has a totally different impact. Chief Irons being batshit crazy from the start is also unnecessary in my opinion. Claire going all ""fuc*er"" and the like is also unnecessary and broke my immersion. I feel like this remake really made a little too much effort in being edgy and gloomy and reduced the good portions of the original game to a small amount.


I want to be brief and straight to the point, highlighting only what's really important for fans of the series and fans of RE2 in particular, from a long time fan of said title to another.
Of course, graphics are great, sound design is top-notch, and overally redesign has proven itself to be accurate and functional. It's truly a remarkable experience, but is it so for the old timers as well?



- RPD redesign : absolutely stellar work here. Going back into the RPD was a joy to behold, and every aspect of it has been kept intact in its spirit and overall function except for a few instances (for example the press room where you had to lit specific candles serves no purpose whatsoever);
- Sewers redesign : very good work, I personally dont like this part of the game but its clear that attention to detail and care has been put into it. The puzzles feel fresh and old at the same time, they're not a chore nor a pleasure, simply something to keep you busy but not annoying to perform;
- Lab redesign : just like the original, it is very short, it keeps the basic layout of the source material while adding a little more to it to keep it interesting and visually appealing. You do the exact same things you did back then, no more, no less. This is by far the most faithful recreation of the lot;
- Weapons : intact, the same you'd expect from this installment. Nothing to add, sound good, look good, pack a punch, nice.
- Mr X : the guy finally does something other than just being there for 5 minutes. He's menacing, powerful, and slow enough that you may feel confident to escape, but he'll catch you again and again. He still breaks walls too. A very fine change, the relentless stalker that he was supposed to be.



- No Lighter : any and all puzzles related to the lighter are gone. The item itself doesnt exist.
- Cut Enemies : no crows, no spiders, roaches are just cosmetic and dont deal damage, no walking mutated plants either, they've been replaced by humanoid versions with much less appeal (basically zombies with vines wrapped around them). The iconic G-Virus breeder, the giant monster that would serve as a boss for Claire, is a regular enemy now, and there are multiple roaming the place. It has lost its status of unique monster and it's very annoying to fight against. It's the replacement for spiders, for some odd reason.
- Cut locations : the Kendo GunShop is only a minor location in the later part of the game and completely detached from what it was in the original. If it didnt have the name on its door it could be mistaken for any other generic asset. The same can be said for the city itself: you are literally at the RPD's doorstep, in scenario A you get to see a tiny, miniscule bit of the alleys, in scenario B you start right inside the RPD without even touching the streets for a second.
- Mediocre voice acting : I cant believe they replaced Claire's original and iconic VA for this new girl who clearly has problems expressing herself. Leon is a piece of wood as well, although a bit better.
- Scenario A and B dont match each other's story : in the original, although some items were in the same place, most of them were shuffled around, and more importantly, the bosses that Claire and Leon fought were different. In this remake, they also fight the same bosses.
- No music : you are hearing just small noises here and there and a few notes thrown around to remind you of the original music, but there's basically nothing, no arrangement of the old save theme, nothing. This is most likely due to the fact that there's a DLC with the original OST that you can play in the game. Not fair in my opinion.
- Ink ribbon system forced on Hardcore mode only : you cant option select your saving method. Either go for easy difficulty and save any time you want, or go for hardest and save only with ink ribbons. I would have preferred a free choice, a middle ground of sorts.
- No ADAAAAAAAAH at the end of Leon's campaign : just unexcusable.


So yeah, take it or leave it, I am enjoyig this remake so far, but I'm not as blind as to say that it's perfect. It has some issues and some design choices are just strange to me. Regardless, I'm happy that this remake exists, it wont substitute the original because it has less content - for now - and it's overall streamlined. We'll see if some of these issues will be addressed or not.",Recommended," January 28, 2019"

After beating the game with Leon and my first impression is that the game is amazing in gameplay, graphics and sound. The story is the same as 20 years ago but with some new settings to modernize some character development or making it more interesting.

[‚úì] The gameplay is a mix of RE4 and classic RE.
[‚úì] Sound design is excelent and 3D sound is must have if you are using headphones.
[‚úì] Rendering, lighting, texture and models are excellent.
[‚úì] Game performance is good and it can run easily max settings without the need of high end rig.
[‚úì] UI is easy to understand, fast and organize.
[‚úì] Enemies are threat and make you think if want to confront them or find a way to pass them.
[‚úì/X] Is more easy than the original but have the same challenge as any classic RE.
[X] Anti-aliasing is pretty bad, using SMAA or FXAA don't work. Also using FXAA+TAA make the game too blurry, TAA is the way to go.
[X] The reflections cause some noise on certain angles.",Recommended," January 28, 2019"

Triggered Mr. X a bit early in the RPD when I still had a few objectives to fulfill and weapons to grab on my first run. Ran away to what I thought was a safe area only to have him follow me in. Ran off to an area I hadn't boarded up because I was hoarding the wooden boards. Zombies poured in through every window and 2 lickers were also waiting for me in that hallway. Mr. X took no time catching up. Had to pause the game for a while to collect myself.



I survived. Somehow.

This game.

People, I mean to tell you that this game is a masterpiece. Coming from the Playstation generation, this game is something of a nostalgia icon for me having played the original to death all those years ago, you can imagine my expectations and hopes were high.

I have to admit this was the first game in a long while I felt some hype; waiting on release day only goaded on by the one-shot thirty minute demo which while constricting, did certainly for me build up ever more desire to play the full title.

It has not disappointed.

Having played only Leon's story line so far this is not a complete review by any means, however, I cannot recommend this enough to fans of survival horror. The game has taken what I believed to be the few good points from the sequals Resident Evil 4, 5 and 6 and restores the faith by dropping some of the game spoiling elements.

This game as one cohesive narrative, for both main protagonists (which changes based on order of play) and brings the story to you in a tense, occasionally time-dependant way.

It might have been easy for the creators to make this game a co-op action shooter of the likes of Resident Evil 5 and 6, however, not doing this is in my opinion extremely beneficial to the game. The atmosphere the superb lighting, sound and pacing delivers is not hampered by having your buddy with you to hold you hand in times of terror.

Having played with an Xbox One controller and keyboard, I can recommend the former over the latter. While the PC port is impeccable I felt the game movement, aiming and controls just handled more smoothly using the console input device. The movement and controls can often by a tad awkward yet this, if not even by design, only helps to create a tense and gripping atmosphere one has to over-come rather than suffer.

Beyond the well written, well implimented story the game sports good graphics with options to up the settings beyond even my medium-capable rig's abilities, even so I was not disappointed with how the game looks. Coupled with a smooth, fast UI reminiscent of if not ported from Resident Evil 7 it makes for an appealing experience of the story.

To summerize, so far, the game has put me on the edge of my seat more than once; scared and thrilled me and challanged me to play at my best with restrictive resources the older titles never really implimented. Revamped enemies, including the shambling Zombies are harder to take down and I challange anyone into the game not to squeel when they first get pounced upon by a series veteran monster,

First time I've felt the need to write a review and, in my opinion, this game is deserving of notice and praise.",Recommended," January 27, 2019"

An amazing remake that meshes both notalgia and the Biohazard engine from RE7, to make a beautiful remake as well as an amazing game. I have been on a multiplayer fritz for the last couple of years and even games such as Red Dead Redemption 2 have a hard time keeping my interest. I am now 26 hours in after beating the game from a Leon A to Claire B perspective and doing it the other way around on a harder diffuculty and I am having a blast. Most singleplayer games I beat only once, but this game has got me hooked for another playthrough. I heard plans of them remaking Resident Evil 3 Nemesis due to the success of this game, and if its anything like this game with the RE3 story and atmosphere then Capcom has another heavy hitter on the way. I knew the Re2 remake was going to be good but didnt expect it to be amazing and a surprise coming out of capcom.

simply phenomenal. because of the camera change, resident evil 2's amazing level design and pace is much easier for a modern game enthusiast to consume. it's a night and day experience playing in third person (as opposed to fixed camera). personally, i could never get into the older resident evil games because of the fixed camera. with resident evil 4 being one of my favorite games of all time, this camera change allowed me to see how well crafted the game actually was. the sheer amount of effort put into this remaster shines through, and i could not be happier.

Spoiler FREE:
I liked this game, played it 15.5 hours apparently within the 1st weekend.
I played Leon A and Claire B and tried 4th survivor 2 times, not beat it yet.


STORY:
The game is pretty cool but defo suffers in the cut scene department.
Character relations feel unbelievable, going from hello to OMG EMOTIONAL YOU ARE MY LIFE!

I can believe looking after a child, but the other character's almost love story feels weird. The story characters don't spend enough time with each other, while most of the time spent in the game you are playing (which is a good thing) I feel like characters should spend a little more time with each other.

Overall emotional beats just come out of nowhere and feel flat. RE7 feels a lot more believable.

MINOR SPOILERS:
Leon and Claire meet at the start and never again till the end. They don't even help each other fight the boss. Claire sees Leon on a tv screen during a self destruct sequence and doesn't even wait a second to see if Leon can get on the train and escape with her lol.
MINOR SPOILERS END:

LOCATIONS:
The new location is under developed, it's just sort of there and gone.
It's like about 4 rooms and no puzzles.

There's a sewer level... yea it's the worst part. I wanted to explore more of the city and environments similar to the police station. RE1 and it's remake got it right i think, there is just something about a good old haunted mansion/ police station in a horror game.

GAME PLAY:
It's quite funny how lickers and dogs cant open doors and seem to reset themselves every time the door shuts. So you can head shot a licker through the doorway, wait for it to go back and open the door again and repeat. But that whole deaf thing? You either have to waste something to deafen them or kill them, there is no sneaking past them.

Tyrant is tense as he follows you around the police station, but also seems to go back and forth for a long time making him annoying as you just hide and wait for ages.
He isn't like Jack from RE7 who wanders the entire house, but he is like Jack where you sort of know when the game has decided he should leave for a while.
He also isn't like the alien from isolation who is actually programmed to stalk or leave u alone at the right time.
They simply gave him a pretty dumb patrolling AI and put him in the map and then take him out when u have triggered a story moment.

I do miss silly unlockable cheat modes.

SCARE:
This game is not as scary as how RE7 starts, without ammo and JACK stalking you it's just super tense. This game has some moments like that. After playing a while you will begin to understand how the game is programmed and will feel more at ease. There aren't any game play surprises. Like all previous RE games, the game is built on certain rules.
RE games have never been super scary for me except the start of RE7 and RE1 remake, but if I was to rank the most scary RE games, RE7, RE1 remake, RE2 remake, Revalations 1 and 2, maybe Code Veronica. Again, all RE games seem to loose the scare factor after the start, but the top 3 do keep the tension.

GRAPHICS:
Overall awesome, I had textures set to high but I still encountered blurry floors or police cars. Also some odd reflective surfaces, due to reflection resolution i guess, looked like moving black mould on some wooden beams.

Oh and the low frame rate of zombies a little far away is distracting... in a charming way? Like haha looks like an old game.


OVERALL:
I bought the Deluxe game after all the good reviews and free DLC announcements, this game is worth it and Capcom defo needs to be sent a message that RE7 and this RE2 remake is the right step forward, unlike the DLC and microtranscations mess that is Street Fighter V.

This game is yet another true display of how to remake a game, second to only the remake of the first game. Although one might say it's more of a re-imagining of the original, despite that, this game still keeps all the same feelings the original had. I had a real joy playing this game, seeing as how I had already beaten the original countless times in anticipation for it, and thankfully, despite some of their recent fallbacks, Capcom REALLY delivered here. The game is jam-packed full of little references to returning fans, and you can just really tell that this game was made with love and passion. Somehow this game even still had that feeling of nostalgia for the original to it.

To sum things up, the game does it's horror really well here, and uses a lot of the same techniques as it's predecessors, but in a way that truly feels new and refreshing. It represents Survival-horror in one of its greatest forms, and will surely have you just dreading what enemies lurk around every corner. Even after replaying this game enough to have sixty hours at the time of writing this, I still found myself jumping after a particularly scary event. With that in mind, even the locations that were also found in the original just look downright amazing in this game, and this might have some of the greatest graphics I have ever seen. Just like the remake of the first game, this game also expands on it's locations and themes, and it really does it just great, particularly the sewer section was redone REALLY well. With classic enemies, and even returning enemies that were redesigned, the game surely does not lack in its share of horror.

Allow me to preface this review by mentioning that, at time of writing, I have completed the game once, following Leon's path on medium difficulty. This review will be as spoiler-free as possible.

I played a hell of a lot of RE2 back on the Playstation and absolutely loved it. I used to believe that RE4 was the ideal blend of tension, scares and modern gameplay and controls. The remade Resident Evil 2 has set the bar that little bit higher, in my estimation. In the interests of avoiding writing a tangled mess, I will try to break things down by categories.


Difficulty: As mentioned, I played on the medium difficulty and performed reasonably well most of the time, with reliable accuracy and decent conservation of resources. I found that the game, for me, tread a solid balance between giving me enough supplies and ammo to keep going without allowing me to stockpile massive reserves of most things (herbs being the only real exception) if I were of a mind to. I'd say that it offered an excellent middle ground and I have high expectations for Hardcore difficulty.

Graphics/Performance: I have a pretty solid PC, running the game with everything set to High or Max. Asides from some hitches I noticed during my first play session, the game generally runs nice and smooth. The game looks beautiful and I have to particularly commend the quality of expressiveness in the facial animations, both among the living and undead. The areas are well-detailed and convincing in their layout, which really adds to the atmosphere of the game.

Sound: Exceptional all round, as far as I have noticed. The ambient sounds in the various areas of the game do a solid job of keeping tension high, especially during a first playthrough. Enemy sounds seem very realistic in a lot of instances, adding to the horror of each zombie or other nasty you encounter. The guns have a really nice meat to them when they fire, at least amongst the ones available to me during my playthrough. I would comment on the solid voice acting, but surpassing classic Resident Evil games in that regard is a fairly low bar.

Puzzles: Overall, the puzzles in the game are not especially trying, though they will exercise your brain just enough to be satisfying in most cases. It's generally not too hard to keep track of what you need and where, though I was pleasantly surprised in a few instances where little secondary puzzles were available off the path towards completing the story, some of which I only realised the answers to after I had passed them by. It definitely feels like the game can hold up to multiple playthroughs.

Horror/Gore: This game does not shy away from the blood and viscera at any point. Damage to enemies that you fire upon is suitably unpleasant to look at, selling both the lethality of your weaponry and the disturbing endurance of many of the creatures you will cross paths with. That said, the game does not seem terribly interested in gore for its own sake in most instances. The overall atmosphere of the game remains unsettling throughout, rather than often feeling like (as much of) a zombie-killing romp the further you get into it, as I felt the original did.

Originality: Overall, I would say that the developers have made RE2 their own. The game retains a definite sense of familiarity while still making the story feel new (or at least freshened up nicely) in a lot of places. Puzzles, layouts and enemy/resource layouts will need to be relearned in a lot of cases, so having experience with the original will not trivialise the experience of the remake.


All in all, a solid recommendation regardless of whether you have tried the original.",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

Works without problems at 1080p/60fps on 4770K + GTX 980 Ti. The only thing i cannot max out is Texture Quality due to only having 6GB VRAM. Yes, this game may probably even utilize 12GB if you have a Titan or something.
Controls are well made for both keyboard+mouse combo and gamepad.

You can get items from Deluxe package as small DLCs on Steam. No hard feelings here either. If you want one skin or just the classic sound package, no one is forcing you to get the whole thing. Thumbs up!",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

Finally... I am safe to say this game encompasses everything original psx series was highly acclaimed for and it adds even more

-tension and action, you will feel your heart pound a lot if you choose a ride with RE2
-it's focused on survival, often you will find yourself backed up to a corner without any ammo or even a knife
Even if you have your 20 or 30 pistol rounds you will be scurrying through corridors in hope of avoiding your enemies, maintaining you inventory is also an important part of the game.
-lots of puzzles of mixed difficulty
-nice story featuring evil corporation trying to destroy humanity
-graphics, animations, voice acting all are 10/10 - japanese quality this game is like Toyota Supra

Running at 60fps on i7 4790k and GTX1070 2560x1600 DX11 all maxed out

Amazing! Positively shock!
The best! Waited for it so long! Of course this is not 1998, Raccon city locations are most dull and undetailed, they said there were bad dialog in original Re 2, so they decided to make some of them even worse, for example - picking up a chick, when behind her dead body reanimates into zombies... etc,
As an Re ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, I dont like how the made a fully ""noir"" concept of endless rain, while half of the game you are going to roam in sewers, water is everywhere.
Too much vanilla drama in dialogues. And lots of other things...
But for new comers it is a great solid game, as an old Re guard, I enjoyed gameplay very much, I amazed and completely satisfied how the made zombies, unstoppable Tyrant and release ideas of Resident Evil 1.5 into their game!
Besides the fact that they cut Water facility, Trainyard station (in original there were 2 trains, Galaxie- was underground only, and another one was used by RE Outbreak heroes to get back into the city)
Anywas the game is awesome!
If you like horrors, zombie games, high tension, buy this game.",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

Very fun stuff. Definitely did not feel like a remake, though. I think the devs came out and said it was more of a re-imagining, and they were bang on with that.

With the original REmake, you had a game that was everything the original game was, plus more, and BETTER. Besides camp value, REmake made RE1 obsolete, which is pretty amazing when you think about it.

That is definitely not the case here with RE2 2019. This will not be replacing the original version of the game, and my suuuuuper early take is that this game isn't as good as the original.

Despite the similar characters, locations, and in some cases, vibes... The original RE2 feels like a completely different game, and I think both will stand on their own as must play games for anyone looking to get into Resident Evil.

One thing I can say for sure is this game scratched that Resident Evil itch that I haven't had scratched since RE4. So that makes me very happy and I can safely say I'm very excited about the future of the franchise at this point.",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

I just finished Leon's first campaign and it plays incredibly well on Steam. The only issue I had was with ASUS Sonic Studio 3 (bloatware) injecting itself into the game on launch and crashing it, once I got rid of that it was smooth sailing. Fully maxed out graphics borderless-windowed while streaming at 1080p60. Not a single hiccup. The RE Engine is incredible.

The game itself plays and feels exactly like how I remember the original RE2. It's tense, frightening, super stressful, and incredibly well designed. Tack on some shiny new graphics, an over the shoulder camera, and few modern touches for new and old fans, and you have a fantastic remake of an already classic game.

Greatest game in the franchise imo although arguable and I am speaking about the classic 1998 version and this remake just took everything great about the game and made it better, still eerie and scary along with more fluid combat than the original and just to top everything off they have the original sound re2 soundtrack so do yourself a favor buy that and just sit in the main hall of the R.P.D station and let the nostalgia flood into your veins, Birkin style.",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

Capcom has done it. Not only did they deliver a complete polished
product, but they captured the spirit of the original RE2 while
modernizing the graphics, gameplay and performance. This is
how remakes should be done.

That being said, if you didn't like the old Resident Evil then this
game won't appeal to you. It's a streamlined, sleaker new version
with most of the old elements still intact. Less action, more survival
horror. No matter how you feel, it is completely worth your time.",Recommended," January 26, 2019"

Not just a remake, but doing RE justice.
Do this. Please. Do it like this again and again. <3
10/10 would buy again.

EDIT: This game is mindblowing me. The graphics are lit. The characters are lit. The atmosphere is lit. The handguns are lit. The grenade launcher is lit. The Tyrant is lit. The police station is lit. The story is enough lit to make it to the lit-list :D

Save them bullets.
Knives wear out.
Boards. Remember to actually use the boards.
Who cares if a ""key"" item has served its purpose, LET IT CONSUME YOUR INVENTORY.
Also, bullets are nice, knives are nicer.

I never played the original 1998 version. RE for me started with 4. Then 5. Then Revelations 1 and not 2 (cause bleh). Then 6... bleh. Then 7. Of the ones I've played, RE4 stands at the pennicle for gameplay, mechanics, atmosphere, and story. RE5, while also nailing atmosphere/mechanics/story, is far more appreciated coop.

This. This is everything I was hoping RE7 to be. The graphics are better. The tone is better. The fighting is better. I am soooo glad they remade this thing into the beauty it is<3 And my goodness is the gore/horror all throughout =O
EDIT: Second playthrough I am noticing how much detail they have in bullet-to-flesh. It is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ly detailed. Like, thankfully this game ain't real xD #attentiontodetail #goregore

As far as glitches, yes I have seen a few lighting issues that others have mentioned, but 95% of the time it runs flawless. Almost tempted to turn down some of the specks just so my eyes dont have to feel obligated to take in EVERYTHING THIS GAME AS TO OFFER xD #notacashcowgame #alegit2019game #thisisonlythebeginning

****Update****

-- Just beat the game, 10/10, easily.
-- Never had any crashes, or strange bugs come up
-- Easily one of the best gaming experiences I've had in a while. I'll try to 100% this game, it's just so much fun!

****End of Update****

Wow, wow, wow! So far, I'm only about 30 minutes into the game, but I can say that this is wholeheartedly the best PC/Capcom game they've released. Loads of PC options, which is somehow rare nowadays in triple-A games. This is a straight up banger for RESI fans.

Would love to see their older games, RE 3 Nemesis, RE4, Dino Crisis, etc on this new engine! Here are a quick few takeaways.

- DX12 running flawlessly so far.
- Running the game on MAX/ULTRA settings (2080 TI) in 1440, Ultra-Wide with no issues, and usually over 100 FPS (100-120).
- Acting and writing are much improved over our beloved classic.
- Gorgeous graphics, physics, and all around lighting/shadows.
- Mouse and keyboard feel great. I was expecting some kind of controller/mouse feel. It's proper here (thankfully)!

I'll update this review when I've completed this game, but for now, you RESI fans out there, this is a MUST buy. At the full $60, you'll feel all sorts of nostalgia, and it just feels fresh. I can see myself playing this again over and over just like the PS1 original.

***A note to Capcom***

Thank you for bringing back so much love and care into this. Continue to release SOLID PC ports/originals, and you'll always have my money if it's anything like this caliber. Bring the best Japan has to offer here on PC, just like you did on so many home consoles! It's Time!",Recommended," January 25, 2019"

As I've said for the demo version, Capcom did it again. Even though I m not many hours in because of work, I just can't wait to finish the day, get back to this gorgeous, amazing remake and finish it in one session. The RE engine is superb and runs well on older systems too, which is rare today, the movement feels so fluid and realistic, puzzles may not be the greatest but they keep you intrigued. Sound design is up there too as it gives you a feeling of uneasiness. Zombies are the best I've ever seen in a zombie game, and the fact that you have to be careful with your shots, not just going bam, bam to the head, but rather shooting their legs, gives it such a nice feel. I haven't felt tension in a survival horror game as I feel when I run past lickers since The Last of Us's clickers (ye, ye, ik they coppied the original REs, but it was so well made) or Dead Space's Necromorphs. Can't wait to encounter Mr. X and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• my pants. I recommend this game to absolutely anyone who loves survival horror games, not ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• fests like RE6. So, please remake RE3 too and give us RE8 as I have full confidence now.",Recommended," January 25, 2019"

I laughed menacingly when I shot a zombie's knee off from his kneecap, I laughed even more so when I used my knife to repeatedly slice a zombie who fell through a window until her limbs had come apart, and her face was no more.

The original series will always deliver that nostalgia factor, one which I don't think these remakes can, but that doesn't mean the remakes aren't good, nor does it mean they're not flashbacks to the past and childhood. This was very well worth the ¬£52.99 preorder for the deluxe edition.

The classic feel of the old resident evil 2 + all the technological advancements we made.

Great optimization and a new and better control system that builds on what was good from resident evil 4 on.

I am just at the beginning so I will update this review, completely confident that it will stay positive, this is the RE game everyone was waiting for.

UPDATE

I have finished the game now and as expected the game didn't disappoint in the slightest.
This is one of those games meant to be played over and over until mastering it doing speed runs, just as the original.

If you played the original you know what to expect, as stated in the first sentence of this review, for newcomers though some mechanics might be a little bit backward given the old school style, not everything was modernized in this game.

1036,Cap,"
I was skeptical about how well RE2 would translate into a fully 3D, RE4 style shooter, but I'm amazed at what a fantastic job Capcom has done of modernizing the gameplay and visuals while still retaining the old school level design and general feeling that you could get your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• kicked at any moment if you aren't watching carefully. This is very much a blend of old school and new style Resident Evil, as opposed to a new style Resident Evil game that happens to take place in an old school setting, which is what I was worried it would be looking at the trailers. My only biggest complaint is the fact that the scoring system still counts saving against you, which is just plain obnoxious. Let me save when I damn well please, thank you very much. The Last of Us remains my favorite ""zombie action/horror"" game on account of its vastly superior writing and characters: the RE2 characters here are still very much the B-movie, two-dimensional kind of characters the series has always dealt in, but it still retains some of the most iconic characters and moments from the series, redone up in a slightly less cheesy manner. What's more, the tense gameplay, gorgeous graphics, and tense atmosphere are second to none.

A fantastic update of the original, Resident Evil 2 is a triumph in almost every sense. The PC port itself is great, with a lot of options to tweak - and the performance is generally brilliant too. For the game itself, it's a tense and nerve wracking affair with a lot of replayability between it's free DLC, multiple difficulty options and 4 different playthrough routes.

The main negative I can draw on would be for fans of the original; the original overlapping storylines of Claire & Leon (which would also change quite a bit if you played it the other way around) are largely gone beyond a handful of signature moments, and both characters fight most of the same bosses and generally do the same things, with a fair bit less interaction between the two than there was in the original. This is a real shame, and a bizarre mis-step in an otherwise fantastic game.

I have never played a Resident Evil game before. In fact, I haven't even really seen gameplay of any game in the fanchise, if you could believe that. So when I saw, to my surprise, that Steam actually carried this legendary-by-name series, I figured I'd finally give it a shot.

I might just buy every game in the catalog now. This game was a blast from start to finish. Everything that happened, from the scavenging for items, to the enemy placement and fights, to the design of the levels and environments, god it was fun. Everything felt fair, everything felt like it had an impact in how well I pulled through.

To preface, there is a lot of good about this game, but I need to tell you it's shortcomings. While the gameplay is excellent, and the game is something like 3 times longer than the original, there is a real lack of context. a lot of the files that we had in the orginal and text descriptions of things we could inspect, are all gone from this. This makes the world feel empty and less lived in. It's a real shame.

the worst part though is how capcom handled the two stories of the original. basically they're gone. this game is one story. except for some bizarre reason, you have to play the same game twice, once for sherry's sections and again for ada's sections (which are ironically different in this remake while they were identical in the original) and the proper ending.
aside from those things, the game is pretty much exactly the same for both. mr X was even pulled from mission B and put into all scenarios.

This was a big disappointment. I was expecting to get a new B scenario with an enemy and events that did not happen in my first playthrough. instead i got the A scenario of the other character and an extra boss at the end. This was so disappoiunting that I just feel the need to warn other potential players.

I don't recommend this if you want 2 scenarios and The rich backstory we came to expect. only buy it if you want an exciting single story with great gameplay and environments and don't nmind being forced to play it all again to get your full ending.",Not Recommended," 28 January, 2019"

Note: I played this game before, just not on Steam, so my hours here do not represent the total play time I spent on this.

TLDR
This game has already enough positive reviews, I will keep this short.
This is not a bad game in general, not a bad survival horror game and not a bad Resident Evil game, it's just a bad remake in general.

Pros
Good graphics
Good gameplay
Great cinematics
Great arsenal of weapons and items
Good redesigns, not very drastic and yet faithful and realistic























When you play the 2nd run (which doesn't come close to anything like the B scenarios from the original game) you start noticing the flaws right away, the only good things are gameplay variations and few scenes that hint at a consistent storyline, the inconsistency becomes wild and obvious when you reach the main hall by any of the two characters, repetitive boss fights, puzzles, etc... it doesn't even try hard.

Hell even the Rebecca easter egg seems like a last minute addition, its just an unproportional lame edit of the RE0 HD render of that costume.

As a result of some stupid ""realistic"" decisions taken on this game (which people were generally fine with), RE3 remake will be much more unfaithful and drastic which hurts my soul as it's my favorite game.

The only reason this game is getting too much credit is because of hype and the fact people were desperate for a survival horror RE game, or just survival horror in general. Sure I love that this is back too but this should've been a decent remake as well, it's not just the survival horror essence - it needed to be a good, faithful remake that doesn't remove and replace, but adds and improves.",Not Recommended," 14 December, 2019"

I'm giving this a thumb down not because it is a bad game, but because it disappoints, doesn't live up to its own setup or hype, and the gameplay lacks the imagination the graphics and environment instill.

The great part is they nailed the locations and feeling of the settings. That was the best part, and almost worth it, but not quite.

But it really isn't that scary, and the actual play doesn't match the move cut scenes. Repeatedly, they will have an incredibly exiting movie scene. An example is when the helicopter crashed into the station, and a movies shows you meeting with the other character (the one you chose not to play) at a gate and fence, and hordes of zombies about to break the fence and attack. Then when it returns to gameplay, all the zeds are gone but three. Same with an exciting gas tanker exploding into a firebomb in the movie, then return to gameplay where all you do is dodge a few zombies in between smoldering cars until you reach the police station. Or at the gas station...or....again and again. It was like being shown a race car, then told the puny go-cart you are given is the same thing.

There is also issue of Mr. X. Some love, some hate, but I can tell you he doesn't add anything other than keep you moving. He has so much potential, again set up in clips, that don't play out in the game. When he first appears in a movie clip, he punches through an exterior prison wall and grabs a man, sight unseen, and crushes his head. He then appears lifting an entire helicopter and moving it aside. But in gameplay, he can't break walls or know where you are hiding unseen, instead prefers to gently push through doors, and isn't good at spotting you. For some reason, he can't get into saferooms, even though a saferoom is just a room with a door, thus making the game mechanics obvious. Mr X feels like a ripoff of ""alien"" in alien:isolation, where he paces the area you are while you avoid him. Except the developers don't do anything creative like in alien where you can hide in lockers, under desks, in vents, or distract the alien with noises. RE2, you can't duck or hide, or trick Mr. X, you just run far enough away he loses you or duck in a safe room. It would be so much scarier if you hid from Mr. X and was afraid he would find you, than slowly jog away until clear.

This last difference from Alien:isolation to RE2 is the key where this game fails. Aliens creates a constant tension because you decide where to hide, when to move, and how to distract, making your choices the reasons for success or failure. RE2 doesn't require much imagination or tactics: avoid Mr. X, kill zeds when necessary, have enough ammo for bosses. You are never submerged in a horde of zombies like the clip movies keep setting up. You can't jump, duck, or hide like a good horror/suspense game would have. Playing the game on harder settings only makes the zeds more bullet sponges, that's it. So other than collecting items, solving puzzles with solutions they give you (literally), slow jogging, and hitting zeds/bosses in their sweet spots, there isn't much gameplay.

They had a chance to set up something special with the duel characters, which had me excited to play again. When you play once, you are a character, but the other character is in the game in other places. When you are inside the gas station, they are outside, when you are in the police station, they are outside. So I was hoping that when I switched characters, they were going to do something cool and original like have me play the other story side. I'd get to show up at the gas station and save the character, or this time I am trapped outside the police station trying to stay alive until the other character gets out. But no. When you switch characters, you play the same story and the other character is on the outside. In the year 2019 for a $60 game, I thought they would be creative enough to give me two sides to the story, but no.

Ultimately, this is a lamer version of Alien:isolation. The zombies in this are robots in AI, Mr. X in this is the Alien in AI. It even has the same weapon issue where a knife can kill a zombie as easy as multiple headshots, like the wrench could kill a robot as easy as multiple headshots. Except AI had more creative gameplay and tactical options, where here you just run or hide in saferooms. This game tries to cover what it lacks in amazing graphics and exciting movie cut scenes, and it works for a while, until you start wishing you were playing the game in the clips and not the one you are walking around in.

It's like a big budget hollywood movie. Beautiful to look at, keeps moving, but doesn't engage or challenge on a deeper level. If this game had a fair balance of poor reviews, I might give it a thumbs up, but as overhyped as it is, it deserves a thumbs down for consumers to know it isn't amazing. It's just a good game with great graphics and mediocre gameplay. If you want to try this game, wait until it goes on sale.",Not Recommended," 30 March, 2019"

Not really a bad gaame, but not one I can really reccomend. My first Playthrough took roughly 4 and a half hours. I did a lot of back tracking, grabbed a bunch of optional stuff, and spent a good amount of time on a few puzzles. I never played the original either, so that didn't factor into the short play time either. Without any kind of nostaglia goggles on, I feel like the game is good, but has some problems. The first being the affromentioned game length. I get there is another playthrough I Can do, and I've already started it, but it's much of the same content, areas, and environmnets, with a few remixed things, it's not an ENTIRELY new game. Next is the enemies just feel, annoying. It's SO RNG dependant on when they go down, sometimes you'll get lucky and their head will blow off in one shot, sometimes, not so much. I never felt like the game was challanging, or scary, I was more just annoyed, and thought the enemies just were getting in the way, chosing to run past them, not because I wanted to ""conserve ammo"" but just because, why bother killing them?

The writing is hit and miss, some of it is insanely awkward, and the chemistry between characters can feel pretty weird at times. Sound and Graphics are both excelent, and some of the best I've ever seen in a game.

I understand it's a remake, but honestly it FEELS like a remake, it feels like an old game remade. It feels short, and some of the ideas in the game feel out of date. If you're cool with this, or love the original, then buy it by all means, but for me personally. I want a lot more out of a $60 game then a four and a half hour story I can replay for another few hours of going through the same areas again. For me, this would be a wait until it goes on sale for $30.",Not Recommended," 1 February, 2019"

I liked the game on my first playthough. Then? Then it made me angry.
If I'm honest, I do actually recommend the game, but let me explain my problem here. I enjoyed the gameplay, I think it's fun and entertaining. The environment is fine, the game looks nice at most times. The plot is a bit messy, and it's rather short. The only reason it took me a bit long is because I like exploring and I took my time to check every room of each map to find everything I could. Otherwise, it would have been over in like 5 hours. The puzzles are fun and I also liked the action. There aren't many types of enemies so I believe it can be a bit boring for some people. The zombies are bullet sponges, but I still had enough bullets on ""normal"" mode to kill almost every enemy so I had no problem with that. (I know, I didn't have to kill everything, but I wanted to.) Mr. X didn't bother me either. He makes the game harder, but I still had half the police station to explore when he arrived, and I explored it anyway. I don't think it's hard to get away from him, because he's slow and there are plenty of safe rooms where I could hide. I don't think he's as bad or hard to beat as I saw some people think. The characters are a bit shallow and somewhat boring. The voice acting is meh, it's nothing special. I bought this game for Leon and I'm a little bit disappointed by how... dull was he portrayed here. Other than that, the chemistry between characters didn't really work well for me, I don't think it was well made. But that's not what bothers me, because I still had plenty of fun playing it.
So. Why did I end up being angry at this game? When you start it, you can choose between the 2 main characters, Leon and Claire. This determines how your routes will play out: the chara you picked first has route A and the other one has route B. In my case, it was Leon route A. This means I solved every puzzle, killed almost all enemies, collected everything, opened all doors/gates and saved the day with Leon. Then, there was no ending. My son Leon defeated the big bad and then suddenly: credits. Then the game told me that I can now play Claire route B and THEN I can see the true ending. Okay, I said. The game and plot let me believe that Claire was minding her own business in the meanwhile and now I can see what was she doing. So I started Claire B. The game cut the full beginning out and started at a different point... and I noticed quickly: everything was back at the start. Everything was locked, every enemy was there again, every puzzle was unsolved. Even the jump scares were the same. Even though I think in my case Claire B plot was supposed to support and add more to Leon A plot, that's not what it did. It doesn't matter who you choose at the beginning and it doesn't matter what you did in route A: you have to repeat EVERYTHING in route B that you just finished doing in route A. Every single thing, puzzles, enemies... You have to do it all over again. I don't care that they have at least different weapons and different lines to scream when they are frustrated. It makes zero sense, because it creates a complete mess of which chara did what: because they do the exact same thing. Other than that, they don't even meet, only at the start and the end, they don't communicate or see each other, when they are supposed to be in the same building at the same time. It messes up the timeline and I simply don't understand who thought it was a good idea to force the player to repeat the game TWICE for the true ending. There are some small differences: you get about 20 minutes to play with yet another character in both routes and have about 3 different cutscenes. Other than that, both Leon and Claire have their own big bad to defeat. Then, whoever had route B can defeat the TRUE big bad in the TRUE ending. Everything else is the same. I truly hate everything about this idea. Now, I have not played the original RE2 yet, so I don't know how this worked there, and it also means that I do not have nostalgia to say it is perfect and flawless, because it is true to the original and whatnot. I think this is ridiculous and tedious. I simply don't see why couldn't they write different plot or make different puzzles or at least create new maps (except a very small one) for route B. The game introducing 2 different characters with different routes makes you think you can finish the game in many ways, but no. The choice is an illusion.
I didn't really want to give this game a negative review... It's not like I didn't enjoy the game or don't think it's good. It is good, it is fun (maybe too short for the full price) and I do recommend to play route A with whoever you like... But be prepared for this nonsense. I was about to give it a positive review, but when I realized that I am now forced to complete the same damned story again for the true ending which is basically just 10 minutes plus, I simply decided to rage quit route B. I will mostly likely finish it anyway, but this completely ruined it for me. I can't give a positive review, because creating a game this way is simply lazy, stupid and unimaginative.
Update: Finished route B (a lot quicker since I already knew where to go and what to do...). My opinion didn't change. There were small differences, but it's basically the same plot twice and this creates serious problems with the timeline. It's simply a mess like this.",Not Recommended,15-Apr

For me this is a very overrated game. I liked Resi 2 back in the day, but things have moved on in the last 20 years, whilst the design of this remake hasn't (other than the controls no longer being awful)

Games being challenging is one thing, but putting a game on hardcore mode and having it be utterly ridiculous is another. It's very stingy with giving you ammo, and is bizarrely inconsistent about how many head shots an enemy takes to put down. Sometimes it will take one handgun bullet, and other times the same enemy takes ten (not exaggerating there)

Those ten bullets will most of the time be all that you have, and there'll still be more enemies to face. So you'll end up running away much, much, more than ever shooting anything.

This is further compounded by making you face bosses where there is the bare minimum of health and ammo given for the task (if at all) and then it instantly makes you do another action / boss sequence without giving you any more.

I'm at the end of the game, and it seems to think I spent the last 10+ hours hoarding bullets because I HAVE PSYCHIC POWERS, AND KNOW IN ADVANCE THAT THERE'LL BE A BOSS FIGHT AT THE END THAT GIVES NO AMMO WHATSOEVER. Yet the game has also made evading enemies tricky enough that I had no choice but to shoot them, so, uh, haven't got that ammo it seems to think I have.

As an example: a boss that you face upon a relatively small platform has a charge attack that kills you instantly, and is UNAVOIDABLE. The game tips helpfully tell you to ""hit it with everything you've got when this happens"", and I'd love to do that, except...well, ""everything I've got"" adds up to the sum of....*fudge* all and the game isn't going to lift a finger to help.

Plus: its normal attack lunges faster than you move, so you're constantly wanting to (sluggishly) get out of range. While doing this it can quickly break out the HOMING UNAVOIDABLE INSTA KILL ATTACK, and you die trying to turn and shoot it in this extremely short window of time......so, so, sooooooo much fun. Every single boss in the game is tedious like this, and having faced four so far not a single one presented an interesting or enjoyable challenge.

For an action game it's riddled with moments where the clunky controls and miserly level design (no ammo, no space to really move) make the action really, really bad. You can't dodge attacks, and once hit you start limping which makes further evasion very tricky. You have no melee attacks without a knife equipped, or any offensive capabilities at all when out of ammo.

Clubbing away zombies with the butt of your empty gun? nah, chief - never heard of it.

Knock a zombie to the floor, and then stomp on it's head while it's prone....er, sorry chief! Never heard of it (despite it being a design idea from a 2008 game - Dead Space)

Shoot a zombie in half with your shotgun to slow them down? er....chief, have you had a blow to the head? cos that there is crazy talk (despite it being from 1998....and, er, is from the original Resi 2.....)

Shoot a leg off, or an arm, or indeed any body part at all, to give yourself an advantage.....er....nah, chief etc etc etc

Bunch of zombies standing by a fire extinguisher, and you get the clever idea to shoot it in the hope that it explodes, taking them all out? er....congrats - you just wasted a valuable bullet! Compressed gas containers don't explode in this universe (well, unless they're in the jaws of a giant alligator and you want to end with some ""big spectacle"" to an otherwise crappy set piece)

I guess making your game very pretty excuses it having even lesser action than the twenty year old original! It feels super backwards compared to the likes of Dead Space, which quite nicely removed a lot of the tedium and awkwardness from the Resi formula without sacrificing the exploration and survival aspect. The Evil Within is also much better at being survival horror whilst giving you a much more flexible character, proper stealth and enjoyable combat.

Action set pieces are non existent (there's not even the faintest whiff of Resi 4 to be had here), the puzzles are stupid, and stealth is a concept it claims to have but in practice it's terrible. There's blind enemies who hunt by sound, so you walk by totally silently and they still move into your path and just sit there leaving you stuck.

You walk forwards - they sense you and you die. You walk back - they sense you and you die. You stand still - they creep forward and you die.....

You expected their AI to eventually move away so that you could proceed? Ha! Ha! You poor deluded fool..... Gotta go back to your last save point, and pray that on the next attempt they have a brain fart and let you pass quickly enough. Is that good game design? I don't think that it is.

Even if the difficulty wasn't ridiculous this would still have enough things that, despite enjoying it up to a point, I'd still stay it was pretty average game play wise. And that nostalgia, or sexy graphics, are covering over a fairly mediocre and outdated experience. 18 hours into the game, and stuck at an impossible bit, I didn't enjoy it enough that I'm going to restart it all on a lesser difficulty!

If I played it on normal to begin with then this would probably be a moderately unenthusiastic positive review. There's enough deficiencies here in the game play mechanics, and in it's rather stunted ambition, that I wouldn't rate it that highly regardless of the excruciatingly badly judged challenge. Game play design that's barely moved on from 1998 doesn't cut the mustard for me in 2019.

When you scrape past an encounter it's tense, and it is this thing called being FUN. But more often than not it immediately descends into being a tedious chore after those enjoyable moments, as the gratification of ACTUALLY SHOOTING SOMETHING inevitably makes the next heavily scripted, and unbelievably stingy, section a pain in the neck.",Not Recommended," 3 November, 2019"

The amount of control you have with the graphics is insane. Total Biscuit would be proud.

There are far too many frustrating mechanics for me to enjoy this game. Being unable to clear out a room of zombies is my biggest annoyance. It just isn‚Äôt worth the ammo since it is so scarce. Shooting out their legs works but when you bait a zombie to give chase then have another zombie gnaws at your legs that you de-legged earlier makes you wish you just wasted the ammo and killed it in the first place.

Wish there was a metal knife instead of all these plastic ones I keep finding.

The hulk has the best hearing I have ever seen. It will hear you from the opposite side of the map and bee line a path directly to you but then doesn‚Äôt hear you when you drop a bell down the bell tower.

The machine gun is the most useless gun in the game. A full clip won‚Äôt even drop a single zombie. After sinking 127 bullets into the head of a zombie it still didn‚Äôt explode.

More Tedium than Survival Horror

Ever since I played the remake of Resident Evil 1 on the Gamecube I had been wanting to see my favorite title in the Resident Evil franchise get the same treatment. To not only receive a visual facelift from its PS1 origins, but also to expand on weaker portions of the original game while enhancing its strongest aspects. This was the degree of care and devotion I always wanted to see out of a remake of Resident Evil 2, but what I got was a mediocre game seemingly uninterested in the title it was supposedly remaking.

The general gameplay feels like a chore. Zombies are bizarrely resilient and usually require multiple headshots to put down, and often they'll just get back up a second, third, or even FOURTH time. Even a shotgun blast to the face can not only be survived on rare occasion, but it doesn't even flinch zombies sometimes. This makes all of your weapons feel weak and ineffective. In the original RE2, blasting a hallway full of zombies would likely kill two outright and knock down all the ones behind them. Here it's lucky if you even kill one and flinch the guy directly behind them with a single shotgun blast.

However, zombies and other enemies can't kill you most of the time. Outside of a few rare instant kills (which you can counter with certain items), you can never die unless your health was already at ""Danger"" when you were attacked. I usually like the mercy of a normally fatal attack leaving you a single hitpoint to try and recover from, but here it adds to the grindfest of ""surviving"". Zombies and others grab onto you with very slow and uninterruptible canned animations (there's no option to button mash for a faster escape like in most games), after which your character knocks them off, you're given mercy invincibility to get back up, use a healing item (there's plenty), which lets you repeat the whole tedious process.

I can't stress enough how much a slog this makes the game. In both old and newer Resident Evil games, certain enemies would be terrifying as they could often kill you even if you were at high health. The original lickers had a jumping slash that dealt a near instant kill from the damage it did while even a more action-focused title like RE4 featured vicious enemies with chainsaws that could kill you instantly if they connect an attack. This kept encounters tense, you never truly felt safe, even if you're sitting high at full health with a lot of ammo because a couple or even a single mistake can spell game over; that is not the case with REmake 2, it's just tedious.

This means the best strategy is just to avoid enemies, which becomes the core approach to gameplay altogether; avoid playing as much of it as possible. Avoiding enemies has always been a core aspect of most Resident Evil games, but here it feels like instead of trying to conserve ammo and other resources for bosses and more difficult encounters, I'm doing it because fighting enemies are so dull I'd rather skip it. I'd often have plenty of handgun bullets to clear out zombies, but it takes so long and is so tedious I didn't want to.

This tedium extends to the non-combat aspects of the gameplay. Of all things I love about the old Resident Evils inventory management wasn't one of them, and having tiny keys take up an eighth of my inventory was absurd twenty years ago. There's no key item section like in RE4, nor even a SINGLE key item space unique to the character like in older games, or separate inventory slots for sub-weapons like REmake 1 featured. EVERYTHING takes up a space, sometimes two.

Most of the puzzles don't fare much better. I enjoy the safes and lockers whose combinations are found by reading files or paying attention to your surroundings; this rewards the player for exploring and feel natural. Less so are miniature safes that require no logic to deduce but just memorizing which lights are connected to which buttons; it's trial and error. Much like so many other aspects of the game, it's best skipped when possible, which is easier since most puzzles have set solutions (except the mini-safes...).

I know I've talked almost exclusively about the gameplay but that's because a lot of the original game's iconic cutscenes have been recreated just as haphazardly. Despite the MASSIVE jump in graphics and the ability to shoot cutscenes in much more dramatic ways, most of the original game's biggest scenes now feel rushed at best and phoned-in at worse. It's clear the people in charge of REmake 2 didn't have much faith in RE2's story but were forced to remake it anyway. It feels like a student doing JUST enough work to get a C-, it's passable but only just barely and certainly not worthy of praise.

Even the music feels uninspired. The dramatic and iconic tracks of the original game are replaced with subdued and generic ones that almost feel like placeholders at times. With the exception of Mr. X's new theme, none of the music stands out to me. However, the game does give you the option of switching over to the original tracks, but only if you pay an extra $3 for it‚Ä¶ and even then it doesn't replace the music in the cutscenes, despite some of the original game's most memorable tracks being tied with important cutscenes.

Most disappointedly, despite some rigid insistence of recreating most of the original RE2 without much understanding of it, a lot of its most ambitious features were dropped. The original game in addition to having two characters each with their own supporting cast and subplot also had an A scenario and B scenario, where certain bosses and plot points are only unveiled when you complete a second playthrough with the other character you didn't beat the game with. This REmake will try to claim it's maintained this feature with its ""2nd Run"", but it's a facade.

The differences between 1st and 2nd run are minimal with the biggest being the true final boss tacked on the end of the 2nd run. Unlike the original RE2, your actions in the first scenario don't affect the second one. You can't possibly screw yourself over by taking a couple of valuable items that you didn't know wouldn't respawn for the second character or see unique scenes you only got by going second. You always fight the same three bosses in the same places with either character in either run, and you always get the exact same character-specific scenes, of which there are a few that blatantly contradict each other despite there being fewer variations to account for.

This lackluster remake would be more passable if it had more features, but there's not a lot to keep you coming back. That there are even fewer changes between different characters and different scenarios gives you less reason to replay the main story. You can try to earn a higher ranking either for bragging rights or infinite ammo weapons, but even that isn't challenging once you figure out the game's various quirks. There's the 4th Survivor scenario, but it's incredibly short and there are no in-game leaderboards to compare times with. And even the Ghost Survivors DLC was little more than a brief novelty.

The lack of replay value stings more when you remember the numerous rereleases of RE2 in the past tried to add more value with each incarnation. The Dual Shock version added ""Extreme Battle Mode"", an action-centric sub-mode where you could play as multiple characters trying to fight your way back into the police station to shut off bombs that had been set-up. The N64 version included a randomizer option, which randomized all non-key items in the game, meaning no two playthroughs would be quite the same.

I think REmake 2 may have finally broken my Resident Evil addiction. It's not spectacularly bad, but it's frustratingly unambitious. Most everything it does has been done better, often in the very game it was remaking, and when not there in other Resident Evil installments. If that's all I got to look forward to from the franchise, I'd be better off calling it quits.",Not Recommended," 7 February, 2019"

I won't say about remake pros because 96% reviewers did it. RE2R probably the best game as part of Resident Evil franchise, but it's very overrated as a remake. Really, too much content wasn't implemented to the remake compared to original game. I'm very disappointed about that. The remake is too short because of lack content and can't overshadow the original game. ""B"" scenarios (you call it ""new game [2nd run]"") are the same as ""A"" ones, what is unforgivable. That's quickie! That's why the remake doesn't deserve to be a GOTY and should called half-remake.

I signed up in Steam specially to pre-order RE2R and that's what I've got.

I know this game has gotten overwhelmingly positive reviews so what I'm about to say will probably be dismissed.

I did not play the original RE2 and thus do not have any nostalgia for it, nor do I gain much enjoyment from how ""faithful it is to the original."" Truth is, it probably is a fantastic remake. However, that tends to mean that many gameplay elements are dated (""faithfully"" so, some might say) and this game is no different. I'm sure that anybody who has been itching specifically for this is getting exactly what they wanted. But as a newcomer seeing the game with fresh eyes, it feels like there's significant trade-off between enjoyment and homage.",Not Recommended," December 2, 2019"

This could have been a good remake but there is just too much that seriously ruins this game very very very very badly. This game may have overwhelmingly positive review but as for myself, I just don't see it.

1. Artificial difficulty:
A). Lots of very very very narrow walkway. This itself is fine but the main issue with this is that capcom seems to like overcrowding these narrow area with ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• tons of enemies.

B). Super bullet sponge enemies. Add these with ""A"" and because of ""A"", you are forced to kill some of them and if you kill some of them, you can kiss your ammo good bye. You can only pray to RNG and hope that 1-3 headshot is enough to kill them. If RNG is not in your favour, you will be losing 10-30 headshot ammo on a single zombie. Yes that's right, 10-30 headshot does not kill one zombie, sometimes.

2. Mr X - Like what the other negative reviews mentions. Mr X ruins this game. Don't get me wrong, Mr X alone is perfectly fine but if you add him along with what I mention in ""A"", then you get a good game mechanic that turns bad.

3. Lickers - These guys are also perfectly fine cause its a thrill to take your time and move slowly past them. You have to move extremely slowly if you don't wanna get fcked over by these guys however, this is ultimately ruined by our old friend Mr ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• X. So you have 2 options here: Either move slowly and get butt ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• by Mr. X run like hell and get shyt on by lickers. Either way, you will lose tons of your hp.

4. More oversized enemies in very narrow space.

This game does not compare to the classic ps1 version in terms of fun gameplay in any way what so ever.

Now here are the good side of this game:
1. Graphic.
2. Puzzles.

And that is pretty much it.

RE2 remake = 2/10.",Not Recommended," December 15, 2019"

The original review is by Neocranium (i love him) go check him out!!!! im slightly editing but my thoughts are the same.
I have been playing Resident Evil games for over a decade. I was hooked on RE2 for the PS1, and played RE1 on the same system, then followed every entry onward with either the PS2 games, emulation or PC ports. I'm incredibly fond of this franchise and its tropes, both narratively and mechanically. So when I looked at the difficulty settings for Resident Evil 2 Remake, I scoffed at the idea of shooting my way through Raccoon Police Department without ink ribbons. ‚ÄúAutosaves [on Standard]?‚Äù No way. ‚ÄúFor Hardcore Fans of the Series?‚Äù Sounds like it was made for me. I selected it and hoped for what I had felt upon playing Resident Evil 1's remake ‚Äì the same, but more.
This game is not that.
It is different, yet less.
Before I get into the downfalls of the gameplay itself, I want to address the elephant in the room that somehow nobody is talking about. There is no Scenario B. In the 1998 original, Scenario B was a somewhat different route for the characters you picked. An armory that was looted in the A Scenario would be empty in B. Devices activated that weakened enemies in A would strengthen them in B. Bosses would evolve in the B scenario after taking damage in the A scenario. Not only that, but paths would change as well. Side characters' fates would change depending on who you played first, leading to four different campaigns for players to experience. In the 2019 remake, it all has been scuffed to who doesn't get Marvin and who gets a sidearm that messes up ammo drops. You do not even get to run from the cop car to the RPD in the B Scenario ‚Äì a first sign of many that corners were cut. Notes in the B Scenario disclosing vital character information were cutscenes in the 98 original, delivering plot in an engaging manner. Ada's exposition stroll about Umbrella in the 2019 remake [ Kendo's Gun Shop to the Sewers ] is delivered throughout the 1998 original from characters in conflict. In fact, most plot points from the 98 original are shotgunned into the game so that the game itself can commence. This method of storytelling in the remake somehow dis-includes the entirety of Resident Evil 1's story line ‚Äì forgoing all information about the S.T.A.R.S. team, the mansion, Raccoon Forest, and the cover up that threatened their lives. Imagine if the film Aliens did not discuss the Nostromo, its crew, or even include the survivor Ripley. We would still have marines blast the hell out of xenomorphs on LV426, but the informed audience would wonder what the hell happened to the prior entry. Capcom couldn't even get the canonical story correct, as it is confirmed knowledge that Claire A, Leon B is the route intended for the official story line of Resident Evil. A story line not even delivered in the remake.
But a game doesn't need the best story ever to be a great game. Doom 93 is still captivating from its first level to its last thanks to amazing game design.
The same cannot be said about RE2 2019's gameplay. On Hardcore, every enemy hits as hard as the next, which makes every encounter frustrating. Zombies can now kill a player in two bites, just as much as a licker can, just as much as Birkin in his final stage can. Damage becomes a meaningless variable to gauge a monster's power when the player is reduced to tissue paper. The weapons are also equally useless. Leaks have shown that damage delivered to the body is always non-specific, which means headshots hit just as hard as arm or leg shots. The chance to crit-hit a head is pointless when leg shots make a zombie almost entirely harmless. On a base level, when a zombie in your game is best defeated by shooting its legs, you are either re-inventing the genre from the ground up, or failed to deliver the expectations of your game's franchise (and the genre as a whole.) Shotguns which have always been the powerhouse of Resident Evil 2 are now useless as zombies can shrug off blasts at random. Advanced enemies will not even notice the shotgun blasting into them as they charge through high-velocity lead obliterating their flesh. The adaptive difficulty in this game creates a sense of constant unreliability as your performance dictates the amount of damage you deliver to enemies. This is incredibly frustrating for me, but it isn't for others. Regardless, the guns in the 98 version put the remake's to shame, as a fully upgraded shotgun can destroy halls of zombies. It was incredibly satisfying ‚Äì something that should have been passed on from the original to the remake.
A complaint can be made that I want the game to be easier ‚Äì or that I should play on Standard. However, I like a challenge. I like to feel overwhelmed by forces beyond my ammo count. Standard suffers from being far too easy, as you stockpile more ammo than the original RE2 gave its player ‚Äì not to mention the ability to save whenever. Hardcore allows zombies to take more lead in their brains in mass than the actual brains that are being destroyed. It feels moronic to be unloading shot after shot into a human skull with no affect taking place. This wouldn't be hard to fix. Add more enemies. The city is completely infected, after all. Take away some of the ammo. Give players a greater sense of conservation. And of course, make guns feel great. The act of using your weapons in a Resident Evil game should feel like a solution. The puzzle to a hallway full of zombies is a shotgun blast that knocks them to their feet. And of course, get rid of the insane magnetism that this game has. Time after time, I have been pulled into an attack that I was nowhere close to. It was so aggravating to be on an adjacent angle from a zombie's grab, only to be sucked into an animation and bitten. Lower the detection range of grabs. It is ridiculous.
A hope that I had was that the Ghost Survivors DLC would patch up the missing story elements in a neat fashion that Resident Evil 7 had done for its DLC. Unfortunately, we got a horribly scored, remixed version of Hunk's escape mode. After going through each available mission and seeing that Capcom was steadfast in their current vision for the franchise, I quickly dropped the game. I wanted to love this game. I love the franchise and have loved it since I was a kid.
My opinion is that Resident Evil 2 Remake is a poor game, but you can observe that there is less sophistication in the 2019 version than the original game that came out over two decades ago on hardware laughable compared to modern smartphones. Graphically, it is great. Everything else was executed by either cutting corners, ignoring the source material, or forgoing an enjoyable experience for a 'scary' one.",Not Recommended," February 3, 2019"

RE1make set one hell of a high standard. It‚Äôs the gold standard for any game remake really, offering the full experience of the original only amplified by updates like Lisa, the crimson heads, some new areas, and other surprises. There‚Äôs a shifting of fundamental elements while retaining everyone, plus more, then a number of extra game modes, gimmicky they may be. The best way of making my point: if I'm going to play RE1 now, I'm always going to play REmake. It provides everything I‚Äôd want of the original game and then some.
[Note: While that's sure as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• not what a movie remake ought to do, and not necessarily the only reason to do a game remake and makes it worthwhile, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs almost certainly the sort of expectation people hold in mind when wishing whatever beloved game of theirs gets remade]

When it comes to RE2make, it‚Äôs not that it does some things wrong though. It‚Äôs about the things RE2m doesn‚Äôt do at all. There's much needlessly missing that absolutely deserved enough development time/care to retain (and hopefully supplant) the original RE2. In contrast to REmake, when I play RE2m, I‚Äôm mostly just left nostalgic to go back and play RE2 for the full story and experience they abandoned in many ways.

I personally don‚Äôt characterize RE2's issues as related to leaning into RE4, though I do understand the perspective. It centers on RE2m jettisoning the original general shooting style for over-the-shoulder aim/shoot again. Some call for more, wanting the fixed camera angles (others even for tank controls), but the central killer-issue shared is that larger gameplay shift change for free-aiming that yields a different experience than the (still enjoyable) classic style of old-school/REmake/REzero games. I'm fairly alright with updating to over the shoulder, finding enough room still to yield a similar enough experience to the original (IMO anyhow) by balancing enemies and elsewhere. I‚Äôd likely have really enjoyed the classic mechanics still too, perhaps even preferred them. However, I can‚Äôt say for sure. It‚Äôs too hard to isolate a feature like that when other RE2m issues distract far more from its pursuit.

Whatever combat complaints aside, RE2make really failed to overthrow the original in even the fundamental recreation aspect by calling quits on many elements prematurely and leaving out certain explanations/plotting events for literally no reason. IIRC, there's no context about the mayor's daughter with Chief Irons; you miss that great helicopter scene; there's X's introduction; and numerous cat & mouse interactions with other characters being seen for whatever reason then separated again I'd trade every non-canon subpar side mode they added just for those characters to retain their rightful roles and context in the already existing story where I can only presume those things still go down the same way, but were sidelined in development in favor of doing/saying/having nothing.

Then you've got this recreation of the police station that's great, and the lab that's beyond fantastic (especially with how they make plants real enemies this time around), yet they TOTALLY cut out the earlier city elements that made it feel... bigger, realer, like an infected city from back in the day that left RE2 feeling bigger in scope than RE2m even now. That moment when you first reach the police station and camera sweeps upward, it's epic and ominous at once. You feel contained in this place because you've got context for what's outside the place. They've added those random quasi-city segments in RE2m during the middle, but with such an odd shallowness (especially after the police station) that it‚Äôs the sort of design depth you‚Äôd get in 1998 anyway. Those parts are merely hallway connections between Area A and B rather than being (and more importantly feeling like) larger set pieces or intersections of something grander.

That missing ""get to the station"" factor, those extra cut-scenes, all these things give the weight of life to the city. You feel so much more you‚Äôre there as it‚Äôs happening rather than arriving at the apocalypse that just already down. Kendo may not seem like major piece, but his struggle and the panic around him adds much texture. Putting him back in the picture, interacting with that chopper pilot, seeing the Mayor's daughter all moving around... even these brief things, create a feeling of a living city where all this other stuff is happening at the same time and you‚Äôre just not around to see it. There‚Äôs an atmosphere amplified by all those little extra Ada moments, Annette encounters, Ben mentions, Chief Irons looming (I am a big fan of his new garage scene & 3rd floor shenanigans though), Sherry scenes, and it all combines in the feeling of active, concurrent chaos. You‚Äôre showing up to the party late, but it ain't over.

I don‚Äôt think I need to emphasis how significantly the lacking A/B and B/A modes is a MAJOR hit, though there‚Äôs more to it with the current characters runs being so damn similar anyway. You basically get Leon A, Claire A with both doing the exact same tasks/beats/puzzles/bosses, but one has a bad Ada segment and the other a bad Sherry segment. They should have at least structured it Claire A / Leon B in an interlinking way if restricting us to one-character path, so we‚Äôre actually getting a complementary story that somewhat makes sense over-layered. RE2m desperately needs that original RE2 vibe that they're BOTH in this city at the same place/time yet isolated to different areas/tasks. While Claire is fighting G, Leon is fighting X, creating the impression of a larger singular narrative coming together. Hell, in the original they'd even bump into each other at semi-regular intervals for a real sense they're progressing together instead of RE2m‚Äôs relatively random re-joining at the end ""oh hey whats-your-face from way earlier!""

It‚Äôs not that RE2m is bad--especially if you've never played the original--and it certainly could've gone much worse. Nevertheless, what we did get is still MUCH LESS than what already was. It‚Äôs almost in grasp of what might have been,but that's probably a big part of what's so frustrating. They got sooooo close that goal was within grasp. And if only one or two elements goofed up, okay that might still be close enough on target. Though the real pattern here is one covering all the bases for ""good enough"" and calling a wrap. They don't go the extra mile the original RE2 does, let alone the extra, extra mile that REmake provided. Sure, it nailed a great gaming base adaptation (imo anyway) and some areas are in-fact the sort of wonderful re-imagining to be expected. Yet so many others weren‚Äôt that, or were outright eliminated, along with whatever other elements and characters. There‚Äôs nothing palatable about rejecting the existing double story (and inverted double story) that made RE2 so goddamn beautiful in the first place in 1998. RE2make never reaches that next level. It just doesn‚Äôt, They needlessly stop short of fantastic remake that so, so, so easily could (and SHOULD) have been given a few different calls earlier and more time later. It‚Äôs like I'd said towards the start, RE2m is a remake effort that just leaves me wishing I were playing the original instead.

Having said my piece, I'd like to mention most of this writing I'd put together before RE3make's release (though ruminated since RE2s first week). I actually started RE3m but stopped early, finding myself *needing* to finish this write-up finally. I've held huge expectations give 3's concurrent development with RE2, fewer snags during, and time after. The demo only elevated those hopes of something that finally matched REmake's achievement. Yet, I've also heard the whispers of the types of changes that tarnished RE2m even while going dark on game this month for fresh eyes.

Not that great compared to the original game, I'm sure posers on here will be frothing at the mouth saying this is just like it but a number of differences simply make this more annoying than fun: zombies are ridiculusly resiliant and running by them is barely even an option anymore since their grab is ridiculously good now, entire areas like the 'marshalling yard' have been completely removed, shotgun nerfed to hell and has zero crowd contol capabiltiy anymore, magnum nerfed to hell basically a pea shooter now, dumb unkillable monster completely ruining your freedom to explore and have fun yeah he was in the original but only in the B scenario and his apperance was scripted of which you could then easily lose him permanantly or kill him neither of which are options in this game unless you basically want to tiptoe around and never fire a shot. Cutscenes are alot less epic and Annette's character has been completely changed to make her more sympathetic, all-in-all a bit of a dissapointment, if the difficulty was made less cheap and tyrant was like he was in the original this was of made the game alot more enjoyable imo, but still would be very flawed adaption of the original, yes ""adaption"" because this not really a remake at all in fact. Furthermore the scope is much more compacted than the original, this has alot to do with removing areas like the previously mentioned marshalling yard but also shortening areas like the city segment in the beginning of the game, the original feels like an adventure or an action film kinda this one is much more subdued and personal I guess?

Do Not buy if you're not already RE2 fan.
I know this game was a legend back in the time on Sony Playstation. I was a poor kid so I never played it. Probably I'd love it if I had played it back then, all though it seems that I would be better off if I had missed out on this one.

I bought this as a Zombie horror game, expecting a decent story plot. Instead, I got a stupid puzzle game, where the only actual hard part is that you have to run A LOT to put every piece together to go from one main area to another where you have to do pretty much the same stuff.

Gameplay:
You can't jump. nor can you dodge. In ""boss"" combats, you're stuck with your WASD. It takes no time at all to craft and consume stuff (game is paused when you open your item box), but it takes you a while to switch from using your knife to throwing your grenade.
About items: your items box is divided into squares. a key of a car, a key card or a gun need the same place in the inventory. If you're playing the highest difficulty, it can get extremely irritating since lower space in the inventory and tougher to kill zombies is all the difficulty is about.

Plot?
There's no plot. about 40% of the game is about getting out of the police station where you should have never gone to in the first place. Out of my 15 hours in, probably 2 hours is the actual game play, 13 hours - screwing around, trying to find missing pieces of broken everything to stick them together so I can proceed forward.

The game has 2 runs. I played as Leo, the cop. in the 2nd run you're a girl the cop linked up with at the start of the game. I thought at least the 2nd run as the lady would be any better but it turned out to be almost the same puzzles for the brain-dead game.

DLC? - joke. You get extra 9mm gun in your inventory that is anything but special and 2 extra outfits for the characters. Funniest part is when you realize that you actually paid your real money for those.

This game could be so, so much better if the devs had actually worked on the gameplay or the plot. A total rip-off of 24.99$, do NOT be as stupid as I was.

If you're looking for some goose bumps, story and action, go play Plague Tale: Innocence.
If you're in just for the story and action, go play Ryse: Son of Rome.
If you want some puzzles and action, check Tomb Rider titles.
If you want puzzles, go play Portal, Talos principle and whatever else actually requires your brains to work.

What a weird experience this game is!

I'm been waiting for this game for 17 years, since 2002 when Capcom made that incredible remake of the first Resident Evil game (""REmake""), and they were planning to remake the whole franchise...until that game bombed and they scrapped the whole thing.
I pre-ordered this game the day it was available, the deluxe edition actually, and now is finally here...

However, while as a survival horror game this is most likely the best you will find, I cant say this is a REMAKE of the legendary Resident Evil 2.
Gameplay is completely different, same goes with the aesthetic, and the whole feeling of the game...this game feels more like an american game than a japanese game.

If I would have to define this game it would be ""reimagination"" instead of ""remake"".

Aside from that, the game isnt perfect either.
The game has barely any music in it (music being one of the best things the original RE2 had), and what's in there, is generic as hell...on the other hand, since this game plays like RE6, you can freely aim for zombies' heads, so they made them extremely hard to kill, sometimes needing 10 shots in the head to be put down, and dont be surprised if a few minutes later you see the same zombie still roaming around...

Puzzles are there, and are as ""charismatic"" as they were in Resident Evil 7, not as ""classy"" as they were in Resident Evil 2.

In short, is this game good? heck yeah, is an incredible game, a GOTY contender, now, if you are a fan of Resident Evil 2, and you were expecting a REMAKE of said game, you should lower your expectations, this is not ""REmake 2"".

Edit: ok, I just finished both scenarios, I dont want to give it a bad rating, but I cant believe very few people are mentioning the many flaws this game has...besides the zombies taking 10 headshots to go down, you have lickers who are literally broken, their hit boxes are all over the place, they will ALWAYS hit you no matter what, while you need to put your gun on their ""nose"" to actually hit them...and speaking of enemies, zombies and lickers are all there is to it, no plants, crows, spiders, you will only have those two enemies...

Visually the police station looks incredible, but it seems all the budget and attention went there, the moment you leave it, the game goes downhill, both visually (it looks like a budget game in some parts) and in level design (you WILL hate sewer levels after playing this game).
I'm starting to think the whole point of 90% of the game being in the dark wasnt a creative decision to make the game scarier, it was to hide how ugly it is in some parts.

Mr X becomes a lot more annoying in scenario B, and btw, aside from cutscenes, both scenarios are identical, you are playing the same game (with minor changes) twice, while 21 years ago, the original game made history by offering a completely new experience in scenario B...on the other hand, this remake tries really hard to be taken seriously unlike the original game which was really cheesy...well, the ending this time around is a lot more cheesy, to the point of almost being stupid...Capcom, make up your mind, either serious or cheesy, you cant have both!

Anyway, this is still a good game, but people saying is a ""10/10"" or going as far as saying is better than the original, are either lying or are blind by hype...

If you are NOT a fan of the original game, this is a good option, if you have the patience to deal with all I mentioned above, but if you are a fan of the original, either lower your hype, or try the game for more than 2 hours before buying it.",Not Recommended," January 26, 2019"

-Cheap enemies. I mean cheap ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing enemies. It takes the whole ammo box to kill at least one. 9mm pistol is simply a waste of your inventory slots. It takes 4 bullets to the head just to have a CHANCE to kill a regular zombie, but quite often, especially if you are trying to quickly shoot you way through a hallway, which is blocked by a single zombie, while trying to run away from an unkillable licker, you are basically ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing dead because the zombie that has just taken 2 shotgun shots or 4 9mm to the head will still grab you and wont let you go until you ficking die. And yeah, the lickers take like 4-5 shells, one of which shot be a headshot. It doesn't sound so bad, but the ammo is pretty LIMITED, so you always have to run away and hope no zombie spawns in front of you.
-TYRANT :) An unkillable piece of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• (the original game did pretty well without him). That thing will follow you wherever you go and even if you hear his steps behind a door on one side of the hallway, be ready for a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing surprise trying to open the door on the other side. It will ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing teleport and grab you as if he had been there waiting for you all along. Again, keep in mind that ammo supply is LIMITED. And you can't simply run away, cuz if will follow you even to the main hall which is the crucial hub and must be safe. It takes 2-3 magnum bullets to the head, but the problem is that you have not more that 30-ish magnum ammo in the whole game. So ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing cheap.

While it does a good enough job translating gameplay to over the shoulder (it will never feel like the same though, that's a given), it's sad to see how much has been cut from the original, or modified, resulting in a largely inferior game that fails to live up to the original.

There are also some technical issues, like the map not unloading at all causing your computer to start ventilating like crazy after playing a good chunk of the game, unless you go back to the main menu to unload and then play to load in again.
The game also has some very questionable boss sequences/fights, which are absolute garbage.

I'm a huge fan of Resident Evil and want this series to get better and continue. So what you are reading is MY opinions and constructive criticism.

Trash game and those who defend this game have never played an actual good Resident Evil game. Micro DLC available for real money purchase to cheese your way and hold your hand through the game. 100% RNG on if a zombie gets stunned or staggered by a pistol shot. The knife registers hits based on FPS which in most cases gives PC players an automatic advantage. Zombies who lunge for you can infinitely re-lunge at you if player is within distance on Hardcore. Didn't appreciate that both scenarios starts the exact same and are almost the same exact in both playthroughs including second scenarios. Lets talk about character movement speed, who the heck decided you run faster in caution? And who decided that only one playable character doesn't get that movement speed? To me if you were going to implement a mechanic like that then every character should get that treatment. Yes, I have played a Resident Evil game like Resident Evil HD Remaster where one character gets a slight advantage over another but if you're rebuilding/rebooting a franchise why not change that too? Too many inconstancies with movement in general especially for stair skating in RE2 Remake,.. I can literally stair skate 3 different ways (I seem to be alone on that opinion on why it's not good). Yes there is some cool speed tech tricks like quick turns, but to me in this situation I think that bad outweigh the good in this circumstance.

One thing I appreciated (that most others did not) was the the different skins/outfits for each character. I enjoyed the toughness of the boss battles and them being almost always intense (without infinite death machines and rocket launchers). I appreciated how hard it was to unlock the OP special weapons until the micro transaction was added that allows you to obtain them all for $5. I appreciated the puzzles for the first two or three completions of the game, but after leaving the game and coming back months later I would have to open my cheat sheet because who reads files after the first playthrough? Loved the soundtrack swap for both 1998 and Remake and I thought both were absolutely astonishing. Gorgeous cutscenes and skippable is a great feature (for replayability).",Not Recommended, May 10

The Good = Claire Redfield is hot. The shooting is more 'difficult' than Resi 4, the overall style is not as arcade-like. Zombies actually feel like Zombies etc. The orphanage mini sequence is surprisingly good, as is the travelling to it, a lengthier-than-you-think section with dogs and zombies and no chance of saving.

The Bad = Everything else. Tyrant is not frightening, not scary, just damn irritating and completely ruins the Police station location. Laughably watching him wait for me to climb the stairs in the library before he did the same. Laughably watch him parade about on the top floor, but never entering the clock tower room, despite him knowing you are in there since you just made the most amount of noise EVER in the game and he literally enters every other door possible.
What the actual hell were they thinking.

Likewise, Lickers are likewise badly designed and unfair. The game says you can sneak past them but you can't, and sometimes the game shoves two of them in a narrow corridor so you have no choice but to blow them up.
Overall the monster design was largely uninspired and for ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s sake the obsession with eye balls has to stop. STOP. WITH. BOSSES. HAVING. TARGET. EYEBALLS.

Did not play again, will never play again. Resi 2 wasn't truly great to begin with but there were at least notable differences between Game A and Game B.

Gonna keep it directly to the issue at hand. The game itself isn't bad, it's a beautiful crafted remake of the old RE2 we know but to be honest, I prefer the original one over this. Why so? Let's get into it:

+ You can notice Capcom reused quite some stuff (from objects assets to the menu itself) from their previous released RE7, I'm not against that, but they could had put some effort into, I don't know, respect the original classic menu?

+ Graphics are beautiful, really astonishing when pushed to the max, but something was amiss, even if the game looked that shiny. Oh yea, the music! Where are the scores? Game is dead silent most of the time, and you would only get one short theme when getting into a safe zone and a continuous one when the Tyrant (Mr X) is chasing you. But yea, don't cry about it, Capcom is willing to sell you as a dlc the original scores of RE2, alongside the classic sfx as well, for a special fee. Instead of being in the game, they cutted it out and selling it apart. Isn't that wonderful?

+ I did talked with people that had the game before the release of the unlock-all key dlc, and they told me they noticed a difficulty increase in the game itself. And I did felt that as well. In the original RE2, a shotgun was a meanie gun, hell, even the pistol could do fine to hold normal zombies and dogs, you would blast most tough enemies with 1-2 shotty rounds and 3-4 pistol rounds. In this game, both the shotgun and the pistol felt like underpowered, 3 shotty rounds at less than half a meter against a licker and it did somehow stayed alive and killed me or 2 rounds on a zombie aiming at his head, it's stupid. Even the pistol, almost 8-10 rounds to a zombie leg to force him on the ground. Like if the game have some sort of RNG to determine if you need just 2, 3, or 10 rounds to take just one limb from a zombie. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• at best.
I ended up being forced to buy that key dlc since I wasn't having any fun at all being lacking ammunition and yes, that the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing knives have a durability bar? Really? I don't remember that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in the original game. Anyways, getting those infinite guns at least allowed me to continue the story instead of dealing with even more lame situations.

+ Mr X. When I first saw him, I really got nervous, loved that entrance and how persistant he is to get your sorry ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• all around the police station. But after being moving around from quite some time, just realized that I wasn't even paying attention on the rooms I was walking into. Instead of searching each room calmly for secret items or pieces of lore to read, I was rushing all along due to being chased but that big old bastard 24/7. That actually started to get boring for me.
The original game had specific parts when that bastard would chase you but after getting to a determined point, he would leave you alone so you could explore a bit more relaxed and dealing with the rest of the T-Virus menace. Hell, if you managed to beat his ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• with enough damage, you would get some cool stuff.
But not on this game.
Here, this special fellow have unlimited life and he would get incapacitated for half a minute or less and then he will get up and search for your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• again. And yes, he do know where you are and he will get you through any door. That kind of perpetual harassment or pressure is annoying, since that, in the original game, after you managed to beat an important battle or dangerous situation, the game will let you have some breath. But not on this one at all. (Just imagine if this guy is annoying as hell with this new AI set, how would Nemesis act on the upcoming remake of RE3? The same AI + guns? Jesus Christ).
Just love the futility of fighting something that can't be temporary beaten even and will breathe on your goddamn neck and bothering you everywhere.

+ They did actually changed some parts of the original story as well to accomodate this remake or even trying to create some sort of surprise element on the people that played the original one. I did not apreciated that tbh at times.

Not gonna lie, I'm kinda disappointed. I expected a remake that would respect the old original but instead found quite some stuff that just made the experience a big no for me. If they only changed the graphics but keeping the rest as it was before, it would have being a blast. All of the previous points mentioned made me reconsider about getting the RE3 remake, I'm just gonna wait to the release date and watch people's reactions and see how the game performs, specially about Nemesis. 3/10.",Not Recommended, February 22

The more I play this game the more I see that it's an amazingly good game marred by some really REALLY bad design decisions.

The visual design and controls of this game are amazing. Controlling the characters feels good and it's not clunky at all. Very responsive and Leon/Claire do what you want them to do exactly when you tell them to do it.

The setting is amazing. The graphics are amazing. Everything about this game is really good.

Except for those bad design decisions. First one is how zombies hurt you. You get close to them then you just take damage. You get schlorped into an unavoidable cutscene where you just watch your hapless ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• get their shins or neck chewed off depending on if the zambo was crawling or standing. I've even had a zombie that I approached from BEHIND just decide he wanted to be facing the other direction on the next frame of animation and was eating my neck. The only way you can interrupt the zombie from doing damage to you is if you have a knife or grenade on you. The knife is lost when you use it until you spend the random amount of ammo it takes to kill the zombie at which point you can retrieve it and unless there are other zombies near this one using a grenade is a huge waste. ""Well, just don't get near these zombies, then."" K. Most of this game's layout is narrow corridors, even in the huge rooms because those have tables that force the room to be divided up into narrow corridors. Zombies also seem to display an intelligence that no zombie should ever have and will sometimes wait behind a door for you so as soon as you open it <SCHLORP!> There goes a knife, a grenade or a third of your total health. This type of ""tense cinematic grab animation"" sucked in the original REs, it sucked in Mass Effect 3 and it sucks here.

The other bad decision hurts me to call it a bad decision because it involves Mr. X. I haven't in a while seen such an awesome idea implemented so goddamn badly. I love the idea of a behemoth of a man hunting you down with nothing but his bare hands in this building because it adds a tension that does RE good. The problem is he is TOO GOOD at hunting you down. I've notice he's teleported to different parts of the police station just to get to me because I wait for him to go one direction then I go the other to my current objective, only to have him show up in front of me a couple hallways down. I know that he can hear running and shooting and will investigate. Fair enough, but even when I'm being super quiet he still manages to find me in this frickin giant castle of a police station.

If this stuff doesn't bother you then go ahead and pick it up. There's a lot of good here and I enjoyed a good amount of this game, but holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is Mr. X an incredulously frustrating (not fun or interesting) obstacle to getting stuff done. Also what I call ""Sync kills"" (because that's what they're called in Warhammer: Dawn of War and I haven't found a better term for them) are garbage ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t because the distance you need to be for a zombie to grab you seems to be inconsistent.",Not Recommended," December 1, 2019"

The tyrant makes this game and unfun chore. At some point in the game, if you fire your gun you have to spend the next 10 minutes running and hiding from the tyrant in a safe room, or he kills you. He's also invincible.

This game has so much going for it: Great atmosphere, amazing graphics, lots of exploration. My main problem is the combat is so tedious.

The gunplay works well enough, it's slow but I understand the methodology behind it. It adds tension and makes every missed shot feel very painful which is what you want in a survival horror game. My problem stems from the zombies as an enemy.

First, how much punishment they can take before they permanently die seems to have very extreme ranges. Sometimes they'll go down (and stay down) after just a few handgun rounds to the head. Other times they'll still be staggering towards you after you've put 15 rounds through the brain. This is on the normal difficulty keep in mind, I can't even imagine what sort of punishment they would be able to take on hard. This is further exacerbated by the low amount of ammo you'll get. I think the most I ever had at one time was around 70 pistol rounds. That seemed like a ton of ammo until I was forced to make my way through a narrow hall where I encountered two zombies where I chewed through 40 bullets. Admittedly I missed a couple of times, but still. To the games credit you do have some small percentage chance to make an enemies head explode when you shoot it, though this only seems to be a roughly 5% chance.

Second, being zombies they like to play possum. This wouldn't be a huge issue if they weren't easily able to wake up and grab you the instant you tried to run past them, but they do and you end up taking unavoidable damage as a result which puts a strain on your limited healing supplies.

Lastly is Mr. X. I'm sure some people enjoy having a big unkillable monster chasing them around, but I just found it obnoxious to deal with him. Since you can't harm him your only option is to stop whatever you're trying to accomplish at the moment so that you can kite him around. He's also extremely persistent and it can take several minutes just to put enough distance between you and him to get Mr. X to stop following you. Then you have to run back to where you were, praying that he doesn't just show up again. I also find it strange that the big haymakers he throws at you just pass through zombies and lickers harmlessly.

I was really enjoying the first few hours, but it just turned into a total slog after Mr. X showed up. Maybe I'm just not the right kind of person for survival horror games. I really do enjoy many aspects of RE2, I just wish dealing with enemies wasn't such a chore.",Not Recommended, April 27

pros:
- the tyrant is now available in the first run of the game
- the gas station at the beginning is fun to explore albeit small
- interesting new plant enemies in the lab
- headshots are rare but extremely satisfying to pull off
- great atmosphere in some areas.

cons: ( in my humble opinion)
-2nd run of each character offers little difference in terms of the walkthrough
- the story of each character does not change correspondingly to whether it is the first run or the second run
-the optional room that requires both characters to register their fingerprints to enter in the original has disappeared( a huge waste of opportunity in my opinion. if they were to add such a room or perhaps more rooms of this sort, capcom could have added interesting optional content such as file that contains extra information leading up to sequels or the events of code veronica)
- in the original game the two protagonists had more interaction whereas in the remake it is possible to remove one of the two and the story would go just as fine. Additionally, in the original game how the first run was done affects the second run in some way(i.e machine gun and sidepack).However, this idea is completely abandoned in the remake.
- Ada's new ""fbi identity"" is strange and her pretending to be a civilian looking for her boyfriend works better imo
- hardly any reference to the original resident evil other than claire looking for her brother. it makes this game feel less connected to the resident evil universe. not to mention the ""John Ada password' reference is now gone completely.
- The remake of the original resident evil 1 featured Lisa Trevor, an interesting new enemy with a back story that has connection to Spencer's mansion. Whereas in resident evil 2, there is no such new enemy.
- the layout of the game is more rearranged rather than extended.",Not Recommended," February 2, 2019"

The original is one of my favourite games of all time and a great game of the time by pretty much anyone's standard. So a remake shouldn't have glaring flaws like this does.

The ammo amount plus the hits zombies can take gets so bad that it becomes stressful and annoying rather than adding to the tension.

No spiders. Something that would have been seriously horrific in a horror game is missing. These were an old Resi Evil staple, one I was looking forward to when entering the sewers.

The alligator section can be quite annoying, unlike the tension and fear generated in the original.

Ada's new high tech toy was fine to begin with but the devs used it to the point it became so damn boring. Its like they were so proud of their new creation that they had to use it every chance they got.

The nostalgia, general gameplay and atmosphere are all good. However the original made me play it over and over. This I will play again but I don't know when.

I understand that I am one of the very few dislikes to this game, but allow me to elucidate here.
Resident Evil 2 was hands down my favorite game of the series, let alone of all time in my personal log of nostalgic video games. Why? The atmosphere was intense, there were items hidden everywhere, there were puzzles and objects to be unlocked, and you felt pretty good about clearing out a room full of zombies.

So why don't I like this remake?
The simple answer is that it tries too hard. Within the first hour I was loving it; weaving through zombies in the streets in order to make it to the police station, basking in the impressive graphics, and getting a feel for the new 'Leon', who is portrayed as much more youthful than previous games. It was great, until the real game play began. You become quickly aware that the average zombie requires 8+ HEADSHOTS before they are down for good. This becomes a serious problem when you never find more than 10 bullets in any given room. This especially becomes a problem when there are 3-4 zombies in a room. This becomes and even larger problem when there is NO 'kick' or 'dodge' mechanic, meaning that if you don't have a melee weapon (none to be found short of a defensive knife early game) you are going to die, no matter what.

The insult to injury was in passing 5 locked doors and 4 combination locks within the first few rooms, and actually needing to pick up wooden planks and fasten them to open windows - but we can't use a simple 2x4 as a melee weapon, right?

My ending note is this:
I get challenging games, I really do. I'm a Dark Souls fanatic, XCOM fan, and a tremendous RE fan - hell, the first remake is literal perfection. This however, is garbage. All these guys had to do was remake the game, but instead they turned it into a walking simulator, because the sheer number of resources it takes to even defend yourself is more than they literally have available. Even if they simply added a dodge or kick mechanic to it, it would make a dramatic difference.
I was so excited about this game, but now I feel robbed of my joy in the original. I simply don't understand how the remake of the first could be so on point, only to have it followed by some truly stupid concepts emulated within this one. I could try to waste my time and beat this, but it would feel like dragging my balls through broken glass, and that just isn't fun to me.",Not Recommended, January 2

Haven't played the original and don't know the series, so can't evaluate the 'remake' quality, but just going to judge this as 'a new 2019 game', so that maybe people who find themselves in the same situation could use this opinion when deciding to make a purchase.

First, the good part: graphics and implementation. The game is a beautiful solid intact experience without any glitches, delivering a well developed atmosphere.

The bad part for me: everything else.

No nostalgia for me, as I don't know the original.

Atmosphere was well developed, but was not frightening/scary at all for me, just dark and gloomy, not my cup of tea. First person would also help with the immersion in my opinion.

Plot was predictable and linear without any variability/surprises, it was not interesting for me to guess ""what's next? what's in the end?"", I basically was sure that next = new monsters / new rooms / new items and main plot point could be easily guessed too.

Characters were beautiful, but kinda 'empty' for me, I was not able to empathize with them, I didn't feel their characters/motivations/feelings/anything was really revealed and they felt easily replaceable; I understand that this is a horror game, so this is okay, but just noting.

Gameplay felt tedious and monotonous with a lot of backtracking and wandering here and there getting green key, green door, red key, red door, etc. Zombie killing mechanics didn't feel very satisfying too, because they are like bullet sponges, so I felt that the game is mostly about running through corridors with shooting just as an option sometimes. There is little variability in how you could play: you only optimize the routes and ammunition you use and try to run through everything to get green key green door red key red door, etc. Again, this is how it ""was intended"" and ""how original looked like"", but I'm evaluating the game 'as it is'.

The world felt a bit ""empty"" too, as if there was nobody using that police station before: all notes were related to either main quest line or keys/doors/codes, there were almost no notes about any side stories of the life of this station before, any stories showing how the people there felt, who worked there, the culture/details about the world, like some story how ""someone was planning a vacation and already bought tickets"" and then you'd find a zombie with these tickets in the back pocket, this kind of thing: not affecting main plot, but revealing the details of the world, something to relate to. So it all felt like all items/notes/everything were only for you to follow quests/open doors/get codes, as if this station was not filled with living people with their life stories before.

This is a perfectly executed game, but this all just didn't work for me, I was making an honest attempt to find anything to catch on here, because I knew it is an awesome remake of a legendary game, but I just couldn't, so I played for ~6 hours to check the atmosphere and graphics and then it all became too repetitive, I gave up.",Not Recommended," February 6, 2019"

To begin with I just want to say im EXTREMELY HESITANT to give this game a downvote. Its really fun at times, looks gorgeous, but in the end its just not what I expected. I cannot help but feel that people who like this game are those people that played it when it first came out, riding the new game on nostalgia. Its so over hyped at this point I was let down a bit. Plus compared to RE 7 its really different. Its not a bad game per sey, but I just expected something more like in RE 7.

1. Gameplay

As a amateur that had never played any RE game before, beside resident evil 7, I expected it to be a survival horror, which it is not. Its more focused on action than survival. Those monsters you meet are either easily predictable to evade or kill if you have the right ammo. If you wanna evade the lickers you do not run, but slowly cross around them, not moving a inch. If you wanna evade a zombie which stands in your way, you can lure them away and run around them when you have enough space. If you wanna kill a zombie that guarantees they wont come back I reccomend you use a ugraded SL60 that blasts their heads, which looks really cool. People praise this game for how beautiful it looks, which it is. But im more focused on the details in the game than the overall look. Now lets talk about them.

2. Mr X

Some people talk about how Mr X is terrifying, which he is ... sorta .... not really. He does nothing but punch you, which is more annoying than anything. I suspect people fear him because you cannot kill him, and you hear his footsteps when hes near, which is ok. But you can stun him, if you have enough ammo and there is way too much ammo in this game for me to use. In the end, I was more scared of the plant zombies that open their heads and chomp on you, which is not even that graphic.

3. Story.

The illusion of choice is really visible in this game. You play as Leon that goes into a room, there is a boss battle with Cool Cat who has now mutated to something monstrous, and then you defeat that monster. Then you play as Claire who has her own storyline like Leon, but every boss battle, except the last one, is the same. Why couldnt it be that Leon battles with the monster, then Claire, in her storyline comes into the room they were in and wonders what the hell happened there? And since this is the 2nd run, which is required to unlock the true ending, why is the true ending less than five minutes boss battle? Why is it in the Leons or Claire storylines, that Mr X dies differently? Why couldnt he make appearance in Leons story but end up being killed by The mutated monster in her storyline? Im going mad from trying to understand how the story in RE 2 fits together. And the free DLC, which I love its free, makes it more confusing for me. The police chief is killed by a girl who is on his operation table instead of a bug that is in his stomach like in Claires storyline. Does that mean she was alive when Claire was going through the orphanage and ... oh ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it. I feel like Im in Alice in Wonderland. Nothing makes sense.

4. Do I reccomend this game? hmmm, yes.

But if you wanna play this game I recdommend you play it at hardcore mode. Its more fun that way, and more stressful where you are scraping for ammo in the dark halls. But after you play this game a while, you start to notice the mechanics and what to do in certain areas and its predictable in that sense, and therefore becomes tedious even at the hardcore mode.

That being said, I think you like this game depending on what you are expecting

Are you: A. Expecting a survival horror where you are scared out of your wits like in Resident Evil 7?

Or B. Are you expecting a third person shooters that is tense and fun running around, mixing ammo and killing enemies?

If its A, I dont reccomend this game.
If its B. This is the game for you.",Not Recommended," February 5, 2019"

Capcom's remake of Resident Evil 2 is something that overall left me feeling underwhelmed. The problems with the game lie with its outdated gameplay and many other issues.

To go further into it the main issue with this game is replayability, I must confess whilst you can clearly see I have put a decent number of hours into this game this was mostly due to me trying my best to like the game. You purchase a game and you try to get your moneys worth, whilst I tried to do that I can't say I have many fond moments playing this game. The game clearly lacks proper different scenarios of the original, hence why replayability isn't that good then the issue of familiarity the game doesn't change from one play through to the next. Essentially the only real reason to replay the game is to speedrun, but we all know that the vast majority aren't doing that and it is just a very small nich√© portion of the playerbase who do the speedruns.

Gameplay, the gameplay isn't fun it leaves a lot to be desired you will go from 1 zombie tanking 10 shots to the face and then maybe the next only taking 1 for it to be downed. Due to that issue it makes gun gameplay feel very underwhelming almost as if you're firing a pea shooter. I think it make sense to mention DA (Difficulty Adjustment) this a somewhat good thing to have, but I think for the most part that you shouldn't be turning a bog standard zombie into a bullet sponge when you're constantly tagging the head. DA works in the fashion that If you're cruising through the game easily and collecting a lot of resources that a potential boss fight will take even more damage (that's fine by me) and this also applies to zombies and other enemies. Final thing to say about the gameplay, I feel as if the game focuses too heavily on hide and seek instead of taking enemies down i.e. do you bother wasting 15 bullets to kill one zombie or do you just flinch it and run past to me I don't find it fun doing that.

Now onto controls, I get the fact that Capcom are wanting to appeal to both sides of a nostalgic audience and a new one but how can the controls be so janky and awful? The character moves at a snail pace and I'll get into that later and the game has a fair amount of stupid things in place which haven't been fixed. For example, Claire when damaged down to caution she runs faster than intended then the issue with stupid things such as aiming in and out whilst going down stairs to move faster. Granted, I'm definitely nit picking with that, but any other huge triple A game you would expect to see things that weren't intended to be there removed what's the difference for Capcom who couldn't even give us two completely different stories with unique bosses for each character!?

Length of the both stories are abysmal and I can delve into this further, whilst your first playthrough might be a bit longer this is very common because you've not figured out the puzzles yet. What happens when you've played the game you know the puzzles and all the locations, you end up with a very short game both stories can easily be completed in a few hours Claire 2 hours and Leon 2 hours and a bit. Now, take out the inventory management and constant back tracking how long would the game be then? Yes, that's right the game duration is fabricated with constant back tracking for items and dealing with what items to hold it's so so silly for a 2019 game to be this outdated.

So I somewhat touched upon this next issue a little bit, the game lacks variety of enemies when you compare it to the original there is obviously a fair chunk of enemies missing. The question is why? We pay the premium price year in and out and we can't get more than a Zombie, Dog, Licker, Ivy and G-Type enemy and some of those enemies you only encounter a couple of times.

Final thing to somewhat trash the game on, animations and sound effects whilst the majority it is good there are 2 things that annoy me. How can you possibly have 5 or more different handguns and they all have the same sound effect!? Absolutely lazy! The animation issue I have is with the guns, I previously stated that gun gameplay feels underwhelming well the animation recoil etc pretty much ties in with how lacklustre that is.

There are definitely reasons to buy the game, but for me its a big no! The game is a play it once and be done with it, I tried to make more of it but I can't really same anything other than I wasted hours trying to like it like the majority of reviews. A trend you will find is a lot of people rating the game positively haven't played it for a long time. The game does atmosphere correct and it does a fair job on giving all the nods to the original but I'm sorry there is just far too much wrong with this game.",Not Recommended, February 28

I am sorry, but cannot recommend this game. At least not as Resident Evil 2 Remake.

Game is good, but is not resident Evil 2. They changed it too much, and is very influenced by The Last Of Us.

The fact is that the original, a very inferior game is way more enjoyable than this redesign. Old one was able to create more tension without the need to make Mr X follow you around the police station. Old one was able to create a better cinematic experience despite the old graphics. Old one was much, I repeat, much better designed. The maps, the pace of action, the enemies, how A and B stories fit and how characters interact with each other...

I dislike that you have to pay for the original soundtrack, due how lacking is the new one.

Re 1 Remake was perfect. Re 0 was awesome. This, this is just a different game that is not able to give me the same feelings as the original. First remake was able to do that and more, this one.... not so much.",Not Recommended, February 18

UPDATE: The developers in their brilliant incompetence really dropped the ball on the extra missions. The worst one is where you play as hunk trying to escape the mansion. You literally are given about 1 bullet per 3 zombies. Not exaggerating. This obvious deal-breaking stupidity of the developers is pathetic. I know it sounds harsh but play it and you'll understand it is very much well deserved. You have to cross single width sewer water in which they intentionally place not just 1 but 2 blimp sized monsters in your path who immediately grab you and poison & injure you. And even IF you use something like a flash bang on them, another example of the developer's stupidity comes from forcing the character into momentary disarray where you can't move and guess what - giving the creature just enough time to grab you again. No point in trying to conserve ammo in running around zombies because the zombies can lunge at you in any direction, one grabs hold of you and injures you giving the rest more than enough time to get to you rinse/repeat. AND to add the stupidity of the developers, they place the invincible stalker zombie back into the game and also cut the time he is dazed if you do use your ammo to stun him. In the campaign you have ammo pick ups/powder and moderate zombie levels. In this stupid hunk version, you have no pick ups of any kind, very low ammo, and 4 times as many zombies as the campaign has. They litter them everywhere so running isn't an option. You walk into a room, there's 6 zombies, you move into the next room there's 5 dogs, you move into the next room there's 10 zombies, you make it to the main hall there's another 10 zombies + the invinci-freak..

All in all I give this game a D- The campaign is fun and the graphics are good, but the sheer idiocy of apparently not having counted zombies-to-bullets shows great incompetence on the part of the game makers. This isn't the princess and the frog, you don't kiss the zombie and suddenly it turns into a human. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• GAME, developers. Way to drop the ball.

BULLET POINT PROS/CONS:
I won't waste your time with some long drawn out nonsense, read the good and bad and make your decision:

PROS:
1) Graphics
2) Somewhat returns to the scary ambience as opposed to the run and gun non-scary path it took since Resident Evil 4.
3) Not too buggy
4) It's on sale [or at least it is as of this review]

CONS:
1) You get 8 quares of inventory, very limited and fills up quickly
2) The game bugs out in the from of gray screened [for example, the sound is still there, you can move and hear it, and you can even see the interaction icon for crates/ammo etc - but the screen is completely gray. I restarted the load game, same thing. I loaded an auto save, same thing. I stopped playing and returned the next day, the saves loaded properly and you could see again.
3) No defense once you're grabbed by a zombie [which they love to have appear right beside you suddenly] unless you have a knife. But even the knife is dumb because
4) The knife isn't permanent. It now has a degrading scale where it will break and now worthless. And by degrading scale, I mean you slash or stab 3 zombies and it's done. In addition
5) the knife is a means for escaping being grappled but using that escape means planting the knife into the zombie and you lose your knife until you kill the zombie [knifing it does not insta-kill, just causes harm]. So you don't get your knife back until you kill it and then go up to the corpse and retrieve it - fine if there's only 1 or 2 zombos - not so ideally designed if you have a horde BUT the knife gets even worse because
6) one of the bugs surrounding it, is that often times your knife will not be retrievable even once you off the zombie you shanked. And I know for a fact that this was not a cause of ""the knife degraded and broke"" because it was brand new. I used it on 1 zombie, I dropped the zombie, went up to the corpse and it was gone. No interaction, no retrieving it, just gone.
7) What in the **** is with needing to hear groans from leon kennedy? The developers designed the character to make as many noises as possible. Walking around normally he starts groaning, running he immediately starts panting. Look I GET that in all video games it's realistic to have the character start panting because they're getting tired, but they made it so he starts panting the second you start running. And if you're walking in tight spaces like between desks or cabinets or tables, or even close walls? MORE groaning and noises. I looked for the Fx folder install to delete this but it's not there to delete. Seriously what the heII? Way overboard on this.
8) The primary handgun is rather ineffective. 4-5 direct headshots to put a zombie down. More if you tag the body instead of the head.
9) And this is just subjective - they replaced the voice over of leon kennedy with some new person. They gave him a voice sounding like he's going through puberty. The lady protagonst Claire, has a deeper voice than he does.
10) There are interactive spots all over that make no sense. Are you approaching an open window and interact? Brings up your inventory. Now I could be wrong, but I don't think a grapple is needed to step through it and onto the walk on the other side. No clear representation here.
11) Lots and lots and LOTS of cut scenes. There is probably just as much time spent viewing cut scenes as there is gameplay. CUT SCENE .....walk over to an alley and go through a door - CUT SCENE -....walk into the room - CUT SCENE....u get the idea.

I recommended this game partially out of bias because I'm a fan of the enterprise, it's not a horrible game it just requires patience. This game is very much accurately priced at $19.95. If you're spending any more than that, pass.",Not Recommended, February 14

This is my first entry to the series, and I just can't get into it. There is a few little things with this game that just annoy me when I'm playing. *Not unique to purely RE2 from what I learned.

-Headshots don't kill zombies when using the pistol (often times it takes 3-4... very realistic like I'm firing nerf bullets)
Now I get that you're supposed to aim more for the legs at times and the object of the game isn't to kill every zombie, but I just don't enjoy this.
-Overall the entire gameplay when it comes to weapons is meh.
-Terrible save points",Not Recommended, May 4

There is a fine line between infuriating and challenging. This game manged to teeter on the edge of that line. But for me it absolutely leans towards infuriating. Some people might consider being given basically no ammo and constantly sticking impassible enemies in your way so you're forced to use what little ammo you do have a challenge. I Absolutely don't. At least in other games they gave you a knife to defend yourself if you run out. Well this game does too but they break after about 10 swings. And if a zombie get's close the only way to defend yourself is to have a knife on you. So you have to pick between wasting what little ammo you do have on zombies that take anywhere from 5-8 headshots to kill or using your knife to finish them but then having no way to defend yourself close range once it breaks. I loved having to be sparing with you ammo in the other games that made it a challenge but in this game it forces you to save before running into a new area learn where all the items and enemies are at, then load the save and run through the area avoiding everything you can and picking up every item. All they had to do was make it so knifes don't break or at least so they last more than 10 swings. If they had the game would've been well balanced allowing me to have a crude way to defend myself if I run out of ammo. Instead I have to just cheese the entire game because I can't afford to waste ammo. I played for an hour and a half before realizing how screwed I was and had to start a new game. And constantly having to back track through areas you've already been before fighting more enemies while having not having access to anymore items because you picked them up the first time through is agonizing. I could understand this if I was playing on the hardest difficulty. This would be fine for a 2nd play-through because I know where enemies and items are at. But I'm playing on standard. The game is close. I would only make minor changes like making knives last longer or not break at all. Or at least make is so It dosen't take so many damn headshots to kill them. It's doubtful anyone would have much of a head left after 3 shots let alone 8.",Not Recommended, March 30

For those who have played the original Resident Evil 2, you might be able to understand why I have given this game a thumbs down. I have only played Leon Scenario A and Claire Scenario B at the moment (as I don't feel like continuing any further for the time being). Graphics are good no doubt, though ""Screen Space Reflections"" has still not been perfected even after over one year from the game's release. After playing a certain game for many hours, you tend to focus less on graphics and more on story/gameplay. That said, I will now summarize my reasons in points:

‚Ä¢ RE2 remake has too few timeline interactions between Leon and Claire. The remake went backwards in where it shone in the past. (You can wiki about it for more detail regarding what I am talking about)

‚Ä¢ In the old RE2, the starting time for A and B are sensibly around the same time. In the new one side B for some reason starts at the point where the helicoptor crashes (totally illogical).

‚Ä¢ In the old RE2, the save system enables more consequential interactions between scenarios A and B. However in the new game, there is no inheriting save system, so your side A actions will cause no specific changes to side B whatsoever. (More detail on the internet).

‚Ä¢ In the old game there are more essential variations in paths, there are boss changes throughout. For example, A would fight G1 G3 but side B would fight G2 and G4 etc, among other things.

‚Ä¢ *SPOILERS* What really gets me is when Annette would appear on both sides A and B to trap Ada or Sherry in the dump and also appear before G3 fight and talk to both characters, and also like die twice. This is the breaking point for me, it breaks the side A vs side B story's coherence completely, and needless to say, is lazy and a bit excessive.

‚Ä¢ If you look at the scripts or wiki cutscene for the old games, ClaireA/LeonB and LeonA/ClaireB actually pans out sightly differently. For example, Ada dies in different places and says different things to Leon, and in one they kiss whereas in the other they don't, among other things etc etc.

‚Ä¢ I think Leon and Claire's interactions are not timely and as a result they lack the bonding they are supposed to have by the end of the game; and both side A and B boss fights and paths to take aren't showing any efforts to weave into each other but remains largely repetitive.


Overall, I think the story is sort of incoherent because of the accumulation of these little narrative details. And I am surprised there isn't any much mention or uproar about this, like it was for RE4 constant lazy remakes. And I will not purchase RESIDENT EVIL 3 REMAKE at all (for obvious reasons) since Capcom thinks beautiful graphics = remakes. I just find it unbearable that people are giving this game a thumbs up, more so for graphics (but I don't blame those that haven't played the original one for doing so).",Not Recommended, May 26

Zombies, Resident Evil old style, music, sounds, details EVERYTHING is great. Zombies are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•IC.
But then theres ALOT of bad things.
- No balance (you grind first half of game with precise footstep or you die, rest of the game is almost infinite amo.)
- Tyrant Its nonstop chases you in tiny space of PD. Theres no fear no tension just stupid nonstop runing and hiting zombie headshots with CS pro level or you will run out of bullets. And on top of that Tyrant teleports draging time in Police Department like 10 times longer than it should be. U can walk slow to prevent teleporting i know. But that just drags unsatisfying game even longer. GOD FORBID if you will not follow OPTIMAL path you google before playing and triger tyrant appearance in early game. Tyrant will force you run out of bullets or HP runing through zombie crowds. ITS JUST STUPID WASTEFULL DRAGING game time that should be less than 2 hours long. Fetch Quests in MMOS are way more fun.
- Scenarions AB is a complete mess from mismatching events of clair and leon to simply LAZY work and almost no difrence between A and B.
- BOSSES especially 1st, u just run around in circle same as with tyrant but this time you ocasionaly hiting dudes eye with pistol while fighting TERIBLE LEGENDARY CAPCOM camera angles. It lasts like 10 min!!! boring running in circle. God fforbig if you shoot him somewhere else and not EYE. you will run out out of bullets in next chapter. 2ND bos puts you in even less space you run around on tiny square while fighting CapCom camera angles.

Ive been waiting a long time for this game... Long time.
For a remake it is amazing the graphics the change of enemy location from the original has changed many have been vastly improved over the original.

But......

Out of all of its glammer and gameplay and depth there is a few unfortunate problems...
Birkin is one of them and the unrealistic amount of bullets it takes to put down a enemy is another.

SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE ORIGINAL GAME

Now this is just one minor problem and it all is depending on what senerio you are on and you fight a different boss.
Instead of meeting birkin (in the original game) for the first time you fight its monsterous failed offspring. Then the next senario you fight birkin himself in that same area. Thats not the case in this one and that is dissapointing. Both runs as they call them feel to0 similure quite a few areas mostly the boss battles.
These important detail would of had me giving this game a perfect review if they had been implemented properly but no these minor issues effect the game alot.

Now overall great game, a great retelling better than darkside chronicals and operation racoon city without a doubt.
And if you are a fan of the series or just the 2nd one like me then you should play it even with its few problems.

At least they got the true ending final scene with that eyeball.... You all know the one im talking about.


UPDATE

Beat Claire A and B and guess what?

All that changed was the intro and outro... Thats it!
How does the original a game made in 1998 have two diverse paths while a game made in 2019 does not?

Still great look and easy to play but after this im sadly lowering my view of this game.

This review should not be indicative of how this game is, but rather what Steam has done, or CAPCOM has done.

You see, I love that CAPCOM has been doing some pretty cool stuff like releasing these remakes, and that they look so great. There are a few issues, but honestly nothing too compromising that I can't enjoy the game. I'll say that it's a condensed version of the original game, and you don't get to experience as much, but it's pretty good all around.

Now, for the real issue, the real meat and potatoes of why I'm giving this a downvote: They added Workshop, and then removed it. I personally think it was due to some saucy workshop mods, and maybe CAPCOM wants to seem family friendly with their rated M game, but either way they need to get over it. Modding was what made me want to complete this game a few more times, it's what made the game have a longer life.

People like modding, and frankly if you want your game to have a longer play life, especially in terms of a linear, easily speedrun game you better let people twist it up a bit. Have funny jokes, do weird ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Sometimes it'll get perverted, sometimes it will get ridiculous, but it's not affecting your bottom end. It's making it all the more successful. Do you know how many people ran for this game the moment they knew they could mod Mr. X into something ridiculous? How many people twisted their playthroughs for streams or just for personal play? Check the download counts on Nexus, and the now gone mod counts that were on workshop. It was pretty great.

Shame on you, whoever decided this was a good idea.",Not Recommended, March 29

Looks great, atmospheric, some good story changes with well done nods to original game. Good and bad animations, can have some very questionable hit detection and awkward looking lunges when you are grabbed by enemies or when you are being attacked by one and other enemies are just bumping into you or attacking through you, but some nice small details like killing a zombie just as it is making a grab for you causing it to slump against you as your character nudges it away.

Camera and movement can make it much easier both to allow and provoke a mindset of charging ahead, really taking away from tense engagements or fear, more so with your last save likely always being such a short time ago. Enemies are now bullet sponges ignoring many shots or later reviving after multiple headshots taking away the fun of combat found in newer titles like 4-6. Mr X is just a tedious annoyance, if he shows up he is easy to avoid by running back to a safe room or through areas you have cleared, he does the same damage as everything else (roughly 33%) so he's not like the instant kill chainsaw enemies of past titles chasing you through barricaded doors. The usual terrible boss fights that all the less action oriented ones have that will likely cause you to waste and horde all your best ammo making normal encounters even worse. While there is a lot of nice detail to the environments, you are in such confined spaces all the time that it makes dealing with enemies more of a bother than anything, it would work much better if they opened up the environments with more of a city location like if they remade Resident Evil 3 like this.

I really didn't enjoy this game at all as it offered no tension in exploration or through enemies and no enjoyment through combat. As much as I disliked 7, it having a new feel to the opening sections (before it became a combat heavy game against the most dull to fight enemies in the series) and some sections that changed things up a lot makes me prefer that one to this.",Not Recommended," February 11, 2019"

Revisit Raccoon City in Capcom's latest remake of the beloved game, Resident Evil 2.

Play as Leon or Claire and a bit of () in both A&B scenarios respectively.

HUNK and TOFU boi returns !

If you haven't played the original RE:2, then you'll probably want to play the original first before trying this out.

-or-

If you have and you're a die-hard RE fan looking for a new experience, I'd wait for it to be on sale, reasons below..

Story: The game is pretty much the same as the original along with improved graphics and controls (you can aim and walk but it will ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• your accuracy). If you're looking for additional content there is the survivors DLC which expands on various survivors that run parallel to RE:2's story, but they're all similarly timed like the HUNK and Tofu modes and they're kind of disappointing (so its kinda hit or miss for me personally).

Enemy variety: What happened to all the enemies present in the original? Mutant spiders, Crows, Evolved Lickers, etc. (This was apparently due to the change for more photo realistic enemies) Zombies, Mr. X, Dogs, and Birkin look great, but wish there were more enemy variety.

**** Scenarios A/B ****
Scenarios A/B for each character feel too similar to each other and there would be no consequences for doing certain actions in scenario A that would be indicated in scenario B (Ie if you looted the armory in scenario A, it would be empty in Scenario B) Bosses and enemies would evolve after taking damage in scenario A and come back stronger in scenario B. Paths would also change as well and side characters that you meet along the way would have different outcomes. This would eventually lead to 4 runs (at least) in the original game. There are clearly a lot of corners cut in this remake especially when it comes to including any information on S.T.A.R.S and the events at the mansion in RE 1.

TL;DR
Overall the game looks and plays great, but if you're a hardcore RE fan looking for a complete experience similar to the original RE2, the amount of content just doesn't make the cut.

Wait for the game to go on sale for 20-30$, this just isn't worth it for price point of 60$.",Not Recommended," June 29, 2019"

An interesting twist on a classic.

Games like these are almost always hit or miss and I have to say that this one was somewhere in the middle. There were a handful of new elements that made the gameplay interesting like multiple new weapon mods, a lot more than just a single inventory expansion, and a few twists on the original storyline that kept me at the edge of my seat. Graphics capabilities were out of this world and the ability to aim freely brought the classic up to date however...

The game difficulty system is broken. Normal was very difficult for me. Being a veteran resident evil cult follower, I'm all for a challenge, but anyone with the thousands of hours poured into over a half dozen resident evil games shouldn't feel like every second of the game is gasping for air barely being able to stay alive...at least not on standard difficulty. That is what the option of 'hard' is for. So we turn it down to easy to get a better feel for the game mechanics and...seriously? Is THIS even the same game? The only challenge I can seem to find here is the team in charge of developing the difficulty settings' ability to understand the balance that goes between said difficulties. All of a sudden I'm unstoppable without any chance of finding a challenge. There's no need to use a walkthrough on easy because you can literally ""walk through"" without any difficulty. It's kind of sad because even with the experience I've gained by playing through the storyline for both characters, I have no desire to torture myself on the next difficulty just at the hope of playing this game through with some challenge.

Mr. X was far too OP. It's impossible to focus when he's constantly following you around and ""at best"" you can only knock him down for a few seconds as opposed to actually killing him temporarily. At first it makes you tense up to hear him walking around and makes your heart stop for a second when the music changes to the sound of him finding you, but all in all he's just annoying. As long as they were making changes to the original storyline for the sake of improving the game they should have either removed him entirely or given you some feasible opportunity to get away from him for more than just a minute or two

Personally I'm not the kind of person who is quick to get offended by vulgarity but at the same time I was born in an era where a game didn't need a ""WHAT THE **** "" in every sentence to be considered a good game. Usually all it took was good gameplay. A sailor would even tell these dialogue writers to tone it down.

Lastly: headshots. Ever heard of 'em? In the original, more powerful guns seemed to have a pretty good shot at getting that sweet critical we all loved so much (no pun intended). At just 2 or 3 paces aimed at the head the shotgun would ALWAYS get rid of a zombies headache. In fact the rare treat used to be that a blast from the shotty would blow their legs off and leave them crawling slowly in agony. Now an entire magazine into the head and nothing...the zombies clearly took more shots to kill than the original which is fine...but if you're going to do that then give the player some balance.

All in all I give it a 6/10",Not Recommended," May 12, 2019"

I'll be honest, the same stuff that bothered me about this game the first time through still bug me but now it's obvious that it's not a problem of bad graphics but just poor game design. The knife breaks after 2 or 3 uses. Wtf kind of knife you using Leon? Like you sticking it in there eyes mate. How does zombie eyes break a knife? Because game. Why does shooting a zombie in the head take 15 bullets? I know I'm hitting them. No more bad graphics to think otherwise. Because game. If you liked this game originally. You'll like the remake. Like every piece of the game is like this. Why no saves? Because game. If you were frustrated by the original and thought, well it would be better if they had a working camera. Prepare to be disappointed as this just makes it more frustrating. I feel this cheapens the game and makes you need a guide to get through it. Instead of exploring the world and having fun with it like RE4, I find myself cursing myself for not getting an item in section B because I didn't check a guide. Now the second I open a door, I'm going to get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up by a zombie I can't avoid. If I could clear rooms cheaply, no problem but again your knife breaks on very few uses.

Having not played the original, I went in with no previous knowledge or spoilers. Clearing on both characters took a combined 10 hours. While there is Hardcore mode or the 2nd Run option, these only change enemy spawns and a few puzzle solutions. As such, I cannot recommend buying the game for full price (60‚Ç¨) right now. The amount of actual content does not warrant that price-tag.

The game itself is good, although (as mentioned) a bit too short. Replayability is limited, since most objectives can only be done in a certain order. The small number of weapons and scarce ammunition also means there's not much variety between replays in terms of weapons or strategy. Higher difficulties devolve into ""dodge the zombie"", as you can only run past everything. The same forced gameplay also appears with certain enemies you are forced to run away from. This feels more annoying than tense, since it forces you to run in circles to gain distance while solving puzzles.

The story, while not as bad as the older games, is still a storm of cliches. It's rather condemning that a minor NPC (the man in the gun store) appears much more human (both visually and in character) than the main protagonists. There were no twists or compelling moments, mostly due to the awkward, cliched dialogue (especially between Claire and Sherry).",Not Recommended," February 4, 2019"

DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!! until Capcom or steam get their act together and solve the extreme stuttering within this game which a lot and I mean a lot of people are having. It's not worth buying, the game concept is great but there are many places where the game is basically un playable and I have read reviews tried suggestions to solve it nothing seems to work. It's frustrating and it's not my PC I have an aurora R9 I9 99oo 5GHZ processor 16GB ram GeForce RTX 2080S 8 Gb graphics card so more than enough for this game. Some reviews say its Steams anti-piracy doing it but I honestly don't know. All I know is this, stuttering kills the game and enjoyment and I'm surprised after all this time that they Capcom and Steam haven't fixed it. (Yes, I am very Angry about it).
OK finished both parts of the 2nd rounds and it's basically a copy of the 1st round unlike the original that does have differences. Also, no matter what I did or my tech support tried we just could not like so, so many other stop the FPS drops. Many times, it was unplayable with a fps of 7. I don't get why the modern games are like that. (From what I‚Äôm reading Resident Evil Revelations 2 is like it as well) If I was to give it a score out of 10 and 10 being great and 1 being terrible and a mess.

Haven't played any Resident Evil before, wasn't the most enthralling introduction...

Wasn't scary, or horror-esque, just a series of artificial jumpscares with some gory zombies. It felt like the lighting was made dark to artificially make it more spooky, but ended up just making it more frustrating having low visibility.

Puzzles are fairly poorly done, and break what little immersion the well-rendered environment and decent acting provided. I'm expected to believe something deadly serious is happening, while I'm sprinting around dark hallways looking for random items to help me progress... and those items make no sense in the context of the game. And that's all you're trying to do in the game, just get the next door unlocked, only to loop back to where you were.

And it was a lot shorter than I expected, I've only played through Leon's story, and it only took about 6-7 hours. Played the whole thing in one day over 2 sittings...

The combat mechanics are poor too. While the visuals of seeing zombies impacted in unique ways by bullets is incredibly well done, there's not enough bullets around to make shooting them enjoyable, 'cause you're always ammo scrounging. Additionally, the character is not agile at all, can't dodge anything, which makes boss fights frustrating.

The character's facial effects were impressive, and are probably one of the only uniquely well-done aspects of this game, in addition to the solid acting.

Not the best RE ever as these reviews might lead you to believe. Game looks and sounds amazing. Mr X is fun but it feels like there should have been more content, more areas. It feels rushed at some points. I didn't enjoy it as much as the original RE2 but it was close. Had a nice couple of scares but it didn't take the place of my favourite RE game. I find there's no replay value in this game unless you want to speedrun the game over and over and over to unlock an infinite ammo weapon to kill the zombies, and there isn't even a lot of them.

Total speedrun game.

All unlocks that are not costume or image related are achieved by finishing the game with S ranks or finding a hidden item. To do this, you need to know the game by hearth (know the map, know item locations and know puzzle combinations / how to solve them before you even encounter them)

Also, some unlocks conditions are not explained in the records sections, so you can only unlocks those by mere coincidence or by looking up a records guide on the Internet.

Not for everyone. I'd really call this review neutral, not negative, minor spoilers are present.

I did play the original RE, RE2 and RE3 back in the day, finished all of them multiple times and returned to replay some of it from time to time. Could never call myself the biggest fan, yet I've got the fondest memories for the series.
Never got into the genre again, tried RE4 and RE1 Remake on PC, controls felt clunky and the whole system of item management was just plain anachronic.

RE7 was a bit of a different story, I just didn't like that much aesthetically to play it myself, just watched the playthrough on Youtube, yet when this remake had popped up it was an instant Deluxe-edition pre-order for me.

Hype train is extremely strong right now and I can really see the reasons why. Graphics are neat, sure could be better, yet could be worse, doesn't matter that much, sound is pretty fine but the atmosphere is plain magnificient.
Still the whole new old Raccoon city police department experience is still behind a thick layer of clumsy controls and annoying item management.
Yeah, I know, that's survival horror, you wouldn't be really scared if you had Quake razor-sharp controls in here, understand it.

Unfortunately, that's not everything for me.
There's a couple of unkillable enemy encounters, Tyrant chasing you and the 2nd Birkin encounter when you have to push him off the platform, I absolutely wasted all my ammo on the latter only to realize you have to move on. Can't remember that happening in the original RE2 to be honest, also there's a freaking maze of the police department, even more so than the original, where you absolutely have to do a crapton of back-tracking and the whole second playthrough is nothing but a hassle for me.
I also hate the hide&seek parts, love the visuals of Outlast and Soma, but damn me if I ever try to play those, no way.

I surely want to finish all of it but I don't really seem to enjoy running back and forth with occasional shooting while being jump scared.

Old positive review:


Good game and I recommend buying it. But lets get to the negatives first so that Capcom hopefully does something about it with future updates:

[Story]

-Zombie Brad is not in the game. Hopefully future updates add him back or if he isn't coming back on RE2, then hopefully Jill will face him as Zombie in RE3 Remake. Else it's going to be a waste.

-Ben's role in this Remake was a letdown. I was hoping to see more of him, not just Leon being an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and then Ben dying all of a sudden [His death was cool but it was too quick].

-Leon didn't meet with Sherry on the police station at all. Even on Leon B. There's literally no connection between him and sherry in this game unlike RE2 and RE DSC. Even if he couldn't talk with her, he should have seen her running away or something like that.

-Consistency error. If Willaim Birkin already breaks the bridge on the underground part of the police station when you play as Leon, the bridge possibly couldn't be fixed in such a short time for Birkin to break it again when Claire comes. I'm not sure if Claire or Leon meets Birkin first but that is irrelevant since the bridge breaks on both campaigns which doesn't make sense. Same kind of error can be seen here and there in the game. There's barely any difference between A and B scenarios for the same character, so at least there should have been consistencies among the story.


[2nd Run]

All they had to do was change few things so that at least the story remained consistent among two runs. Like if on first run G! already attacked Leon and broke the platform, then Claire should have G1 fight in the same area with all the environments damaged. The platform shouldn't get repaired magically.


Same goes with G3 where the room should already be damaged and they shouldn't meet Annette or even if they meet her, she should be injured and in the verge of death so that the story makes sense with the first run.


Certain puzzles like the statue door should have some other way to open it other than putting the medallions since those were already placed in the statue. There was no need for clock tower puzzle to reappear in 2nd run either. Just put the electronic parts somewhere else ffs. Or maybe there was an extra electronic part on the clock tower room so that you didn't need to do the same puzzle again.


So far, all they had to do was make some simple changes for the story to be consistent. Also, having no street segment on the 2nd run was disappointing. The street map is there in the game, it's playable on Ghost Survivors. So why they didn't include it in the main campaign? It was alright for Claire's campaign since she got some street segments. But for Leon, there should have been a street segment on his 2nd run since he doesn't get any street segment at all.


[Enemy types]

-I didn't see different models of Lickers. Was expecting different Lickers on the lab.

-No spiders at all. Having at least few of them on the sewers would be great. Maybe just one spider as mini boss.

-Crows should have been at least present on cutscenes or something.


[Technical aspects]

-Lack of proper support for different aspect ratios. Only 16:9 is supported properly. 21:9 works during gameplay but cutscenes are pillar boxed. 32:9 and multimonitor aspect ratios are vert- [vertically cropped]. What's funny is that cutscenes are letter boxed to 16:9 and yet they are vertically cropped lol. 16:10 and 4:3 are letter boxed too.
There should be options to turn off black bars and the cropping should be fixed. It's not like it's impossible cause all these problems are unofficially fixed and are available here on .

-No option to turn off vignette. It makes the game way too dark. Again it is fixed by fans [See the link on WSGF above]. Having the ability to turn it off would be great.

-Ingame contrast slider would be great too.

-This game has sharpening filter which works well with TAA but any Anti Aliasing setting other than TAA suffers from severe sharpening which looks downright ugly. An option to disable sharpening filter would be great so that SMAA and FXAA can be used.

-Interlaced mode on PC looks noticeably worse than Xbox One X's interlaced mode as you can see on Leon's hair which shimmers weirdly on PC with interlaced mode with TAA. A small fix on this issue would be appreciated.




These are some of the few things which if fixed would make the game a GOTY material for me. The game in it's current state is already great and was totally worth the 60$. The base game is long enough and enjoyable to justify the 60$.

Ok, I will start with short list of positive things. First of all. I am a big fan of the series and I was waiting for this remake for too long to witness so many things that drove me crazy while I was playing. I am really happy that I didnt pre-ordered this game and that I was waiting for a discount deal. Sorry Capcom, but like I said. I was waiting too long for this remake (all the fans did) and this is what you come out with ?

Aiming in the game is extremely ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. You literally stand in front of zombie and shoot directly at the head and for some magical reason it will not hit the spot ! Considering how valuable ammo is, this is really irritating.

Firepower. In every other game, when you shoot somebody in the head with a shotgun, he barely walks again (in old RE2 its head blew into pieces) here, it is no problem for zombie to bite you after that.

Idea of Mr.X to hunt you through the half of the game is not scary, it is anoying. You are scared for the first time and than it is just always there. At least in old game if you put him down he didnt come back right away but like I said in the right moment to scare you. Waste of ammo and nerves.

Ada campaign. Ok, so obviously creators of this game dropped all the logic with this character again. Sunglasses in the dark police station is just the beginning. Special agent on a dangerous mission in the city infested with zombies with a simple gun, but no ammo, no first aid kit ?! Are you for real ? Another frustrating part of the game.

Absence of special cover moves ! This is probably the worst mistake. Do you remember playing RE4 and everytime when boss was about to hit you, you pushed the right combination of keys and you ducked or counter attack the enemy ? Well guess what ? HERE IS NOTHING LIKE THAT ! So when you are fighting Tyrant or simple licker, the are extremely agile (jumping, throwing things at you, swiping space with their claws...) but you can only use basic movements aka wheel chair motorics.

Locations. Creators could expand game more into the city. Leons way to the police station could be more interesting also some mini scenario about rescue or searching for supplies outside of station would be nice. Also there is quitte long campaign in the sewers but than one in the laboratory, there is like one floor ? Another wasted opportunity to show more of Umbrella Corporation.

Basically no interaction between Leon and Claire through the story. In original RE2 you met each other from time to time. Here you will basically meet at the beginning and in the end of the game.

Later dialogues are really painfull to listen. Especially Claire scenario is beyond idiotic.

Zero horror efect after first half of the game. Especially bonus mini games are just about running, running and running.",Not Recommended," May 2, 2019"

A total and complete disappointment. Worth $20 at max. Considerably less fun at every skill level than the original. Enemies don't attack anymore, but trigger a cutscene when they stray too near to you. Combat is therefore reduced to a coin-op light gun game from the 90s. Better land those 20 headshots (or sometimes 1) it takes to kill a basic zombie before he lurches over to you and a Skyrim Killcam plays. If your pistol decides not to do damage today, you're taking a hit. Because the original game had 3 levels of healing items, (1 green herbs, 2 green herbs, 1 green + 1 red), so does this one, despite the fact that every single attack in the game from bosses or basic enemies puts you into 1 hit from death. Every single enemy in this game kills you in two hits, because they have no basic attacks and Claire and Leon are terrible at protecting their necks. The weak ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• plants from the original game's lab now 1 shot you from any health level if you look at them the wrong way. The original RE2 is a massive speedrunning game, however, RE2Make is dead on arrival for speedrunners, due to the giant disjointed hitboxes where enemies take 1 red herb off you every time you get hit, and basic enemies (with random placements on room entry) having instant 1 hit kills that can phase through doors when you open them before the enemy is even visible.

This is a frustrating soulless game that punishes you for trying to play it like the original. The original RE2 is a blast. Something went wrong. Next time Capcom remakes a Hideki Kamiya game, they shouldn't try to force in a bunch of elements of modern Western Horror games like Dying Light and Dead by Daylight. A remake of a Hideki Kamiya game should never have forced stealth and puzzle bosses, but here we are.

6/10, it's better than RE5 and 6, but not better than 1, 2, 3, Veronica, or 4.

Update: I've now spent a few hours trying the Claire playthrough as well as the second playthrough with Claire that I unlocked by playing through the game once as Leon, I guess in an attempt to justify the asking price for this game. But they're all the same. Sure you have some different interactions here and there, some enemies are in different positions, dialogues are different, but you're still playing the same levels in the same order, doing the same stuff, finding the same items, solving the same puzzles, and the solution to most of them hasn't even changed so if you memorized them or wrote them down you can just sprint through the game by this point. Claire has different weapons, but just as before you barely get to use them before the game is over. I have no doubt you could play through this game in a couple of hours. It's by far the shortest full priced AAA game I've ever played.



This is the first Resident Evil game I've bought and the first AAA game I've bought full price on Steam in ages and I'm so disappointed right now.

I've seen let's plays of Resident Evil 1, 4 and 7. With RE7 I regretted not buying the game myself because the action looked fun, the puzzles were varied and interesting and the boss fights looked cool. RE1 was just too old to enjoy for me by the time I watched it, but what struck me about that game was that it looked more focused on the puzzles and less so on the action. And the puzzles looked just as good as in RE7, if not better. I love puzzle games so both these games look like they would please me for this reason alone. RE4 even though it was a lot more action focused looked overall really cool to me with its many weapons, upgrades, enemies, bosses, locations and solid (for its time) shooter mechanics, but it was also too old by the time I watched it.

Cue the extremely hyped, extremely good looking RE2 remake. The best game in the series they say, and this must be true, why else would they remake this particular one? Surely this is my time to try the series out. If it's better than 1, 4 and 7 then there must be a lot in this game for me to enjoy. I try the 1-shot demo and it teases me with seemingly intricate puzzles and amazing zombie/shooting mechanics. I'm sold, I buy the game.

And then the game is over. Wtf? 7 hours long. Exploring everything, seemingly discovering every secret, and still it ends in 7 hours. I could probably have done it in 4 hours if I didn't go after every secret. I honestly didn't realize there were AAA games this short. Usually my problem with AAA games is that they are too long. But even worse than that the gameplay in those 7 hours was mediocre at best and most of the time is spent going back and fourth in the same levels. The puzzles teased in the demo you're given the solution to immediately, no need to think. The rest of the puzzles involve matching colored keys to colored locks or square shaped pegs to square shaped holes. And the only good thing about the shooting is the zombies. All the other enemies feel rushed and boring in comparison. You can't shoot their limbs, they don't even have ragdolls, they just die in the same way no matter how you kill them. Not to mention how few of them there are. There's only like 5 enemy types and less than 10 of each of them excluding the zombies. And there are no proper boss fights in the entire game, you're just fighting the same ""bosses"" over and over which would barely be considered a difficult or notable enemy in similar games. In fact the game just progressively gets worse in my opinion.

I realize now that the game wants me to play it again slightly differently multiple times. I probably have to try that to see if it's in any way worth it, but how can it be any less mediocre? And multiple playthroughs is in no way a justification for a short game length. When a game like this is too short it makes the things you do while playing it feel even less worthwhile. All the items you've gathered and didn't use because you saved them for when the tougher enemies or bosses would show up, worthless, the gun upgrades you found just before the game ended, worthless. This game was so short that I barely got to use 2 out of the 4... (lol) weapons in the game.

And worst of all it wasn't until right before the end that I realized I had been tricked. I'm usually able to tell within the 2 hour refund window if a game is for me or not, but everything I thought I knew about gaming and the Resident Evil series (from watching the aforementioned games) and also what the game made me feel when playing it led me to believe there was still a lot left. I had only faced a very limited selection of enemies, my weapons and items were basic and some of them I had just found or found the upgrades to, I had only faced trivial puzzles, everything led me to believe the game would truly get going soon, and then it just ended.

This game needed more of everything in my opinion, it needed more enemies, more enemy variety, more bosses, more horror (the main antagonist is a tall blue dude wearing a trenchcoat and hat, lol), more locations, more varied locations, more weapons, more items, more upgrades, more puzzles, more story, more actual length.

I'm honestly so surprised right now. I can't for the life of me understand how my opinion can differ this much from seemingly everyone else. From the looks of it there are far better games in the Resident Evil series than this one, not to mention games like Dead Space just blow this one out of the water in every regard.

Lastly, to add some positivity to the review I'll say that everything that the 1-shot demo shows you is fantastic. The graphics in this game are fantastic, the sound is fantastic, the atmosphere is fantastic, the zombies look and feel fantastic, shooting them feels fantastic, and it both plays and feels like a proper PC-game in terms of how it runs and the settings you can tweak. Shooting the zombies is fun enough that I'll probably mess around with cheats doing that for a bit, and maybe I can hope for some mods or more content from the developer down the line as well.

Game is good as a concept and a good remake, but it's freaking SHORT. Get RE6 it's way better and it's coop. This SP RE2 remake is great as atmosphere and graphics, but it's lazy as hell, plus playing with 8gb texture you still see some ""console grade"" textures here and there so i really don't understand where the 8gb of textures are since past the 4gb and playing in 4096*2160 I see no difference in textures at all.
The rest of effects are smooth and here's some new technology that is very refreshing, expecially regarding zombies. But yes Capcom, it's hella short wtf. 8 hours and the next character campaign is the same as the first one while you could have actually made 2 different ones as you hint while playing as Leon. That's lame.
Anyways it's good for a sale like the 20 bucks I paied, not more.

I enjoy the game at the first glance, the graphic are great and it scares the S**t out of me. However all changed when I started it again after I finished my first Leon run.
The 2nd run mode is a joke. same map,same puzzles, same boss fight. Nearly zero interaction between Leon and Claire during the story. Most importantly, the story makes no sense at all. so many critical information is missing, especially for fans of the old re2. What make the classic re2 the best of the RE series is the perfectly fit AB side story in which Leon and Claire help each other all the way to the end.

Do not buy if you're not already RESIDENT EVIL fan. I never played the original RESIDENT EVIL 2, when I first got into the game it was really fun and had great graphics and a good setting. The puzzles were simple and easy and the game was actually pretty scary. Then I finally got out of the police station and went down to a sewer area of the map to fight a boss which was fun as well. After a while I found myself back at the station which was sad because I thought I would go to different places of the map and not just go back to the start which made me sad. I keep playing the game and I ran into a character named Mr.X. Mr.X was one of the bosses you fight in the game, which seems fine but then I found out that you cant kill him until the end of the game, so he becomes a pest and makes the game no longer scary and also makes the player rush through the game. As the game goes on the puzzles are no longer fun because it just a lot of running around trying to find a key or an item to progress. This becomes very repetitive and I keep playing just so i can finish the game and get it over with. For half of the game it felt like a chore to play and the pacing of the game was all messed up due to Mr.X and making the player rush through the game and not letting them have the freedom of messing around or going at there pace.

The game mechanics aren't great. Firstly, it takes too many headshots to down an enemy and pair that with the lack of ammunition yields you fairing poorly.

Now comical incompetence aside, at least in The Walking Dead they'll stab a zombie in the head.

The biggest mechanic of this game is simple puzzle solving, where the puzzle is mostly finding the right key and unlocking a door. Shooting in the game is either entirely frustrating, if you shoot a zombie in the head, it seems as if nothing even happened, so when you spend another three to five rounds to down it, it will still get back up and you repeat the process again. Now this wouldn't be a problem in a action game like RE4 or RE5 where the ammo is plentiful, but in this game ammo is somewhat scarce and the game doesn't feel like it rewards you for removing a zombie from the area, but more punishes you for later parts of the game when you need it for a tougher enemy. And later during the final boss fight during leon's story, it really seems like the way to beat it is to wait until the game finally decides you can beat it.",Not Recommended, February 18

I guess I'm guilty of not being affected by nostalgia as much as the rest of the fanbase, but I can't get over taking 4-5 HEADSHOTS to down a zombie.

It KILLS my immersion when I pop them several times in the forehead with a pistol and focused reticule just for them to keep shambling at me.

I get that they want the zombie's death to be a bit of a mystery so they can grab your legs when you run by, but they can have 1 forehead shot be a down and still have the jumpscare 25% of the time without an issue.

After months of thinking over this game i have to say that i wouldn't recommend this game as a fan of the original RE2, this game was made to wrangle up new fans who have never played the og resident evils and thats plain to see.

I will say that the game started out strong and was enjoying it a bunch but as soon as you left the RPD you could see it started to go all down hill, it was apparent that they rushed this game out with the lack of areas,enemys including crow,spider,moths,super licker and ivys( the plant zombies in the lab are not ivys but just a reskinned zombie with visible weakspots) and on top of that they ended up on reusing that bland invintory menu from RE7.

I could list off more stuff but i will leave it at that, so to put this simple if you are new to resident evil this is a fun game and i would recommend it to you but if you are an og fan this isn't really the RE2 you remember.

after playing this game for about 6 hours casually i will not recommend this game at all. visually this game is great the voice acting is great and the ambiance is great, however this game keeps respawning the same zombies you killed and the game doesnt give you enough ammo at all im stuck running away from everything and thats 100% killing the experience. i dont have any ammo to fight tyrant or anything for that matter and yes ive found as many gunpowders as i can, tried running away as much as i can but there isnt even enough healing to take a few hits and keep going. VERY POOR design around that gameplay and its not fun in the least which sucks cause i had high hopes for this after seeing previews and whatnot and this makes me think that RE3 will be the same in terms of ammo and healing which is an instant turn off and that sucks cause the originals are absolutely fantastic. the second worse thing is a durability knife, really??? a military grade combat knife that only lasts about 10 hits is sad i mean thats hardened steel were talking about and it cant cut more than 10 swings through rotting flesh?? not having a solid backup weapon even just a knife ruins gameplay even more. its not fun to have to speed run through a game so you have enough resources to play the later parts of the game. this is my opinion and if im missing something like caches of ammo or anything please tell me i want to like this game but as of now its a thumbs down, 6/10",Not Recommended, January 10

EDIT: SPOILERS!!! A LOT OF THEM!!111 PEEPS REPORTING SINCE I DO NOT HAVE THIS DISCLAIMER!

I have about four complaints.

1. Mr. X is basically Jack Baker in this game. He will follow you everywhere besides Safe Rooms. I find it excessive. The original had him showing up and disappearing places. I liked that better than constantly having to waste time and ammo with him. He would literally fall down, then get back up seconds later on ""standard"". This game was not built like Alien or even Resident Evil 7. So getting chased around forever is just another way of game padding.

2. It feels like they ran out of ideas, so they took the self defense weapons from RE 1 Remake, they took the constant persuing from Resident Evil 7, they took the gun powder mixing from Resident Evil 3 and much more. I didn't really find it to bring anything new to the table. It is a remake after all, but they did say they tried to change it up a bit as well.

3. The characters don't make sense anymore, Ada became so cringy, but it is not like she wasn't anyways. The reporter died from Mr. X instead of Birkin, which was interesting and the entire sewers got a bit less spiders.

4. They seemed to have took out a lot of enemies like crows, spiders and even the cool plant creatures. All we got were plant zombies.

Other than that, the game is pretty and really fun to play for about 10 hours, then it becomes a massive chore. If you are like me with nostalgia, you might wanna play it for the extra modes and then hop out. So that will be about 30 hours or so. Hopefully Resident Evil 3 gets a better treatment. Oh yes, they took out a lot of introductions for the characters and creatures. Mr. X does not drop from a helicoptor, he just suddenly appears and the same with everything else.

Gotta say the game itself is pretty good.
Graphic's great, story is pretty good and solid, just like the original game, feeling is good too.
BUT, the gameplay about the enemy's, it's... the worst!!! 3-5 headshots to kill a Zombie?! A Normal Zombie!? JEEZ!!!!
Than you are also quite tight about the ammo a lil further into the game, when you run into even worse enemys, mutants, and the worst. Mr. X!
You have often no ammo, no a simple meele weapon at all. So, you can just run for your life like a scared chicken, instead of fighting back at all. And IF you find a knife, well, enjoy it, since it won't last past the 4th enemy, and probably won't even kill one.

things I don't like:

-Capcom changed some aspects of its plot, which most of them are dumb (including characters, like, was really a need to change them too?).
-Balance, adaptative difficulty makes enemies bullet sponges, which there wasn't a need to do such thing, the original was already a challenge without that (I've completed the game to the point I have S+ rank in every difficulty and I still hate that) and some enemies are broken *cof*lickers*cof*.
-Route B doesn't exist.
-The movement system is dumb and slow, I hope they fix that in REmake 3...
-While the soundtrack isn't so bad, it's Tnot on the same level like the original.
-btw capcom, immortality in animations it's something from the 90s, like, come on, you can't put that kind of things in a 2019 game....

If you are looking for a remake that leaves behind what was ridiculous about the original, such as a crappy inventory system, a laughable ""plot"", a clumsy movement system, a boring gameplay that consists of running back and forth through the same locations for hours just to solve stupid puzzles in locations that can only be conceived by ill Japanese minds... well, in that case, leave this game alone.",Not Recommended, January 5

I did a blind playthrough of the Leon campaign in under 6 hours. The Claire campaign will be anywhere from 2-4 hours.

This is only a at most 12 hour playthrough, 12 hours being generous. It is very concerning that this game was sold at full price, and the RE3 Remake will be even shorter, with the same maps, and sold for 60 dollars. This is a concerning trend, however much I love the idea of this and a modern take to make their old games more accessible. However there needs to be more. I can only imagine that the content of the actual game was limited by hardware at the time.

There needs to be more content, levels, and boss fights, and story to justify the price being asked of this release and future RE remakes.

Great game though, really liked it. 10 hour full price AAA game--go suck my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• dck Capcom",Not Recommended, January 28

Level design is great, really wish the combat wasn't opaque, misleading and random beyond human comprehension.

everyone has their own pet theory about how the combat works and they are almost all wrong and frankly this game is an amazing case study in how to deliberately screw with player perception but it's created such a miasma of bad data about the game that it's become totally insufferable to attempt conversation about it.

also Mr X is mostly just annoying and the game isn't really especially scary. I do think it has great ideas but overall, this is not the direction I want for this series.",Not Recommended," February 11, 2019"

Worth buying on sale but not full price.

I never played the original RE:2 but I did play RE7 which is what made me excited to try this. RE:7 excelled at immersion and this game does too, visually it's almost flawless, character's facial animations are the worst aspect but they are still forgiveable, it absolutely nails atmosphere. It's a game that has some really fantastic attention to detail but also a lot of oversights like how zombies just don't follow you into the main hall of the police station until you're far enough into the game, or how Leon can get bitten time and time again but never become infected.

It feels nice to play but it suffers from the same problem RE:7 did in that the game forces you to wait ages between firing shots, this is obviously to heighten tension but it gets frustrating when you get into the later part of the game and have to fight a handful of enemies at once, it's not scary at the point just annoying. Another issue is supplies, I played the game being very careful with ammo and equipment but I had to reload my game twice in order to beat the first boss because I forgot to go into the bossroom with a knife (which is never indicated to be essential) as even with a HUGE amount of ammo the first boss soaks up damage easily and there's not enough ammo/equipment in the bossroom to kill him so it entirely relies on the player being lucky enough to enter with a surplus.

By far the worst thing about this game is the writing, I'm sure it's faithful to the original 1998 game but I don't think that's a reason to forgive how poor the writing is. Leon will do that thing where he points out every little detail and talk to himself just incase you, the player, are too stupid to figure things out. He'll walk up to a locked gate which requires a keycard and after you inspect it, see it requires a keycard he will say out loud to no one: ""Huh, guess I need a keycard.."". Also you meet another character later on who only shows up for cutscenes then manages to magically disappear inside a small, locked space, only to reappear from nowhere again when there's time for another cutscene, a cutscene which details how you escape from that confined area and how that character helps even though it appears they already know another way out. Another example is this character tells you that the only way to continue your path is to jump down into a sewer drain, upon doing so you get into a boss fight, end up hundreds of meters away from where you started and then the character just magically appears from a door where you end up; completely contradicting the idea that the path you took was the only one. I get the RE games tend not take themselves that seriously but it does help if they atleast try to make sense.

I haven't finished the game though I am near the end, whether or not I will I don't know because it does another thing similar to RE:7 and that is that it turns into an action game by the end, a very boring action game. Enemies have cool designs but they lose their scare when there's room after room full of them and for most of them they have very long winded animations that give you plenty of time to just gently jog by without them even turning to catch up to you. This game is at its best in the beginning when you're running laps around the police station gathering items and managing your inventory to solve puzzles, it's at its worst when it tries to be a shooting gallery.",Not Recommended, April 17

How annoying it is that you can get past the 1st stage of the game and face the boss, but then you can't defeat the boss because you missed a weapon somehow in the 1st stage.

No you can't go back, you have to start all over again. 3 hours wasted

Anyway, it's okay but not great.

The cut scenes look a lot nicer than the original but the game feels a little clunky and is inferior to the more modern games.

Didn't play the original back in the day so there is no nostalgia attached which seems to have influenced many others feelings on this game.

A good game, game-play, audio, graphics and characters were solid.

Though the dialogue did feel a little weird at times.

But it's pretty much the exact same game masked as 4 separate campaigns, you just play as 2 different characters, with 2 of the campaigns being a means to get an extra (bad) boss and the ""True"" ending, which is the same for both characters so there's basically no need to do the others 2nd Run. It was a slog to get through each campaign after the first since its practically identical.

Finished each campaign in around 5 hours.

Extra modes aren't that great.

I think the short Demo fooled people into thinking this is something it isn't and considering the amount of actual content i would pay $20 tops not the $60 asking price because for all it's looks the game is just empty and shallow. In 2016 a very Orange man with a really bad Wig started a nationwide movement to ""Make Resident Evil scary again"" - or am I thinking of something else? Nevertheless as a result we got Resident evil 7 and now unfortunately we have this. I must admit that I was one of ""those guys"" who were disappointed this was not going to be a fixed camera remake and am doubly disappointed that there isn't going to be a fixed camera DLC with it either so the scare factor with this depends entirely on how you play it. If you approach this as a stealth game in the first couple of hours it can be really scary however if you play it as an action shooter it gets old really quickly. My honest opinion is that this version is neither good or bad - it's patchy and does indeed seem very rushed after the half way point. Once you get past the first couple of weeks there is really no replay value, certainly people will not be talking about this in 10 years time as they did with RE 1-4
While it is unclear whether this is an actual continuation of the RE1 remake or takes place in the RE7 Reboot Universe the opening act is really well done and designed to hit that nostalgia button, you will enjoy recognising old locations and thrown a few curve balls with changes to item locations and puzzles. Despite the change in perspective it still does really well giving you that nervous claustrophobic feeling with a good scrip and good acting but once you get to the secret underground exit something just goes ""off"" about it and loses it's identity in the same way RE7 did. Things pick up again for a while with the first Mr-X encounter - who looks like Frankenstein joined the Mob - but then it becomes more of a chore than an enjoyable experience for the most part. No doubt the cheesy one-liner ""Barry-isms"" that start creeping into the dialogue are fan service but they just feel forced and awkward breaking the immersion, this along with the backtracking (of which there is a great deal) just doesn't work for this version taking away from what it built up in the first couple of hours and is just there to serve as padding.
Again this is neither good or bad but this game just can't sustain what it started and I would much rather have a well crafted but shorter experience than long drawn out chore with the Ada and sewer sections being a particular low point where it goes into full CoD tedium.
Things that really annoyed me are that the campaigns are virtually identical with only a few - and I mean very few - differences and locations, surly in this day and age Capcom could have come have come up with two separate story lines that complimented each other without being self contradictory?! Unless of course we are meant to believe that Leon went around putting everything back where he found it and reset all the lock combinations.
The other real gripe I have is that the wonderful new soundtrack is MASSIVELY underused and could have been used to great effect countering the tedium factor of the backtracking, however, as with RE Zero 80% of this game is played in almost complete silence with no atmospheric background music. And what happened to the iconic Save Room tunes? They are almost entirely missing! No doubt this was a cynical move by Capcom to force people into buying the actual soundtrack - Bad Form!
In conclusion this game is neither good or bad and I would give it a 6 / 10 score tops but I do wish that I had waited for a sale as the asking price does not reflect the overall enjoyment you will get out of this. What we have here is indeed a very rushed version and considering the time and staff it took to produce it there is no doubt a number of scrapped versions that are probably much better which are locked away in a filing cabinet somewhere at Capcom.",Not Recommended," February 3, 2019"
1258,Blarghalt,"
First thing's first: this game is not a remake. That's an outright lie. It's nowhere near the level of an upgrade that, say, the Gamecube RE1 was over the PS1 version, and this game is like three time shorter than the original RE2. It'd be more accurate to call it a reimagining with better grahpics.

Anyway, onto the review.

I suppose I'll get crucified for this, but I'll just lay it out on the table now: I've never thought highly of the Resident Evil series.

That is, I never thought highly of the first three Resident Evil games and its spinoffs, thinking they were mostly exercises in frustration with a laughable plot and the worst controls a human mind could conjure. I never, not for a second, bought the argument that bad tank controls made the games more scary, because I think bad controls are inexcusable in almost every circumstance.

I *loved* Resident Evil 4, mostly because its much better gameplay and large departure from the convoluted mess of the first three games, and so it was to my disappointment to see all the lessons from 4 squandered with RE5 and 6.

So now Resident Evil 2 has returned to us twenty years later, and after playing this remake for a bit, I've come to the conclusion that my distaste for the early RE games was justified. Even with modern technology and a third-person perspective, this remake can't hide how flawed the Resident Evil series was before 4, and in some areas seems to have even taken a few steps back.

I suppose I should start with how much the game likes to throw toolbooths in front of you. These aren't toolbooths where you pay money, but ones where you are forced to cough up weapons or health. This happens any time you encoutner any zombie, and although the game likes to make a song and dance about how you're supposed to avoid them, many times this is simply not an option. Zombies can lunge at a huge distance, and the often cramped corridors where they pop up often means there's no way around them other than killing them, or letting them grab you so you can knock them down. I don't know how they made it *harder* to avoid zombies even with the loss of the fixed camera and the tank controls.

A lot of times, running isn't even an option, especially when you run into stuff like the infected dogs or the Lickers. Those times you *have* to fight, because while the controls are somewhat tolerable now, Leon and Claire both run at about the same pace I do walking to the kitchen.

And this leads into my second problem: in this remake, the knife is a limited-use item. It basically combines the self-defense weapons from the old gamecube RE1 remake, where you could stab zombies with special knives you found. The problem is those knives were seperate from your actual knife, which you could use even if you run out of ammo.

You know what happens if you run out of ammo here? Game over. You just wasted however many hours got you to that point. You don't have a knife to fall back on, and even if you do, it'll break after using it for an absurdly short amount of time. It's not even that useful, having a shorter range than a zombie's lunge, so you can't even really use it in an offensive capacity.

Playing this remake also made me remember how much I loathed the inventory system, where a herb and a shotgun take up the same amount of space. I hate having to come back to the RE4 well, but that game did it so much better, where you had limited space, but items all had a different size and took up a different amount of space. Hell, I think in RE4 if you found a health item but your inventory was full, you could still use it, but in this game you can't for some baffling reason.

I think that's the reason RE4 was so popular and so enduring even now; RE1-3 were just plain bad, and when the fans played an actually good game with its name, everyone was enraptured.

Enemies are also way too bullet-spongey. This goes back to the toolbooth problem. It's not enough to even headshot a zombie anymore, now you have to do it about 5 or 6 times before they actually go down. A zombie going down quickly from a headshot isn't a reward anymore, it's a damn requirement, because otherwise you're going to expend half your ammo on one enemy.

So that's my opinion. The Resident Evil 2 remake is a valiant, but ultimately doomed effort to fix what was fundamentally broken. The game isn't scary by any real metric, just frustrating, just like it was in 1998.",Not Recommended," January 27, 2019"

I was a huge fan of the original Resident Evil games on PS1, and my first exposure was with Resident Evil 2. Unfortunately I don't think the remake lives up to its predessor. While the graphics, voice acting, atmosphere are stunning the mechanics of the game completely ruined the experience for me.

You should get this game if you:
Don't mind dying in the game
Like to challenge yourself in video games.
Were a fan of Resident Evil 4 and Newer.
Don't mind the sneak, conserve, dodge and retry play style.
Like scary games.

You should avoid this game if you:
Don't like when developers force a particular play style on you.






In general my opinion is that the game is difficult, but in a bad way. The developers clearly want you to play the game a certain way which is to dodge and avoid enemies and to conserve ammuntion, but the game mechanics don't really offer a good way to dodge. Sure you can time their forward lunge and spin around, but this almost feels like an exploit of the games mechanics, not a legit tactic. Zombies take far too many headshots to actually go down making it virtually impossible for someone who likes to methodically clear areas to enjoy the game. So I swithced to assisted mode thinking, maybe less shots (barely) and maybe more ammo (again...is there more ammo?), but instead I felt like I got was some annoying auto aim which I really don't need. All I want is more bullets or the zombies to go down in 1 or 2 headshots. Dump ""assisted"" mode and replace with ""easy"" mode for those who just want to relive the nostalgia.",Not Recommended," February 2, 2019"

[Base on Hardcore]

EDIT 3: analyze why Mr.X didn't really work at the bottom.

EDIT: I forgot to mention RNG bullet crafting, you can get either 2 shotgun or 3 shotgun ammo from the same recipe, have fun reloading so you don't get 33% less ammo for no reason.

Hardcore was poorly balance, I play the 1st area (police station) without killing and licker and kill only 4-5 zombie with gun, (and 3-4 using knife, which break faster than made-in-China plstic fork) , I look the whole station blue, yet I do not have enough ammo to kill the 1st boss. I can only kill him after 3 try and until I make no miss fire.
I load my save to check the ammo count, it's [41 handgun, 9 shotgun]

The aiming is also bugged with the camera and character. the crosshair doesn't intercept with where the character is pointing. Sometime the character will perform some animation against enviroment, but the crosshair doesn't. Your character can have shotgun sinking into zombie model, but it will still miss cause the zombie isn't at the middle of the monitor.

Mr.X was intimidating for around 5 min, then he become the most annoying enemy in the past 5 year of gaming history. Mainly because YOU CANNOT LOSE HIM. Mr. X will walk to player with pinpoint accuracy and there's no way to lose him unless you go into save room. Then when you exist he will start chasing you again.
This won't be a problem unless the game think this time is the best time to introduce you to 1st puzzle that require player to move bookshelf around, which are extremely time consuming and leaving the player completely defendless. So the whole puzzle become....

[move 1 shelf]
[Mr. X enter room]
[run accross the whole map to save room or the most opposite room, both option took same time]
[run back and move another shelf]
[repeat 5 more time]

This whole section took almost 2 hour because of this (including the time I die bacause lurker bodyblock the door).

Oh, also it has denuvo, to add salt to injury.


EDIT 2: And magnum need buff, It's not magnum if it can't even kill normal zombie in 1 shot.



EDIT3:

The amount of hate Mr.X receive got me thinking why people hate him, but not Jack or Alien.

1. Transition feedback (Mr.X is mute)
When Jack or Alien found you, there's clear indication. Jack will yell 'found you' and Alien will scream and switch from patrol to chase behavior. While Mr.X never do any of this. There's no clear indication whether he found the player or just in patrol mode when he enter the room. This mean player doesn't know what's the best action to take in the situation. RUN or HIDE.
And this bring me to 2nd problem.

2. Lack of danger/tension (Mr.X is too slow in chasing)
Mr.X don't really change his walk speed in either 'chase' or 'patrol' mode (yes, it change a bit, but both speed are still outrun-able by player so it didn't really matter), being found by Mr.X didn't translate into 'danger', it just translate into 'time wasting.' Since player can outrun Mr.X unless they are in dead-end (which Mr.X is scripted to not enter), this mean being found is 'fine...., now I have to spend 2 min losing him before getting back to where I am.' Mr.X is only a threat when player have to doing something that force them to stay in one place for some time. (cough, library, cough, cough).

3. Lack of proper stealth (Leon/Claire are too prideful to lower their head)
I think this is the most important problem with RE2 & Mr.X.
In RE7 & Alien, player can getdown behind cover for the 'high risk, high reward' of not having to go around jack or alien, but doing so also put player in their range. RE2 don't have that, so there's less way player can deal with Mr.X.

4. Map design (Police Station need new furniture)
The police station isn't optimized for 'immortal chasing enemy'. Most room are corridor-style room which doesn't provide 'table' or other object that player can use to circle around Mr.X. There's also a lot of dead end. So when opening into Mr.X player has only 1 option, get back from where they came. This also mean there's no 'high risk, high reward' of lurking mr.X to circle around the 'table' so you can get pass him without running back to previous room.

5. He didn't kill you, the zombie and licker did (Mr.X act like timer referee when you fight)
Here's also another reason why people may hate Mr.X. He didn't catch you up and kill you, some random zombie grab you or licker make you walk, then Mr.X catch up and finish you. Mr.X act like a timer in these situation, timer that a lot of people hate. When Mr.X show up in the room where player played smart (ignore zombie to save bullet), it means player cannot make slow smart manuvour to manipulate zombie or licker out of the way, and force player to kill those zombie / licker ASAP or Mr.X will kill them.
This punish player who try to play the game as survivor (saving ammo, avoiding/evading enemy, leaving enemy alone) and reward gun-blasting player (who has happy time running around since all enemy are dead already).",Not Recommended," January 26, 2019"

I am using a creative sound blaster X AE-5 one of the top sound cards on windows 10

This sound bug has been there since the game was launched on Jan 2019 and has not been fixed, i very much doubt it will ever be fixed.

My advice is stay well clear of this game and to boycott all Capcom games meaning to stop buying there products they develop as if they truly cared about the games they develop they would of fixed this months ago.

All they want is your money and to sell you useless games so don't get sucked in by them the only way to get them to do something is to unite together and stop buying there games until they take responsability for what they are selling to the public.

this game is very dragged out and it takes way too long to progress, zombies take way too many shots to die which isn't a problem if you get enough ammo which you don't. the story is amazing for players with enough will power to complete it but most of what you do in-between the cutscenes are boring puzzles or searching for items that are scattered all over the place. i had to youtube what to do several times which completely ruined my experience and even with help from multiple youtube videos i was still stuck in the same buildings for hours looking for things which is no fun at all. if you want to complete the full game you have to play 4 versions of the same story which are practically identical which is asking way to much of normal players and the DLC barely adds anything new to the story or to the gameplay and is extremely lazy in my opinion. i don't understand why so many people love and think it's a masterpiece it has so many things to dislike about it.",Not Recommended," December 25, 2019"

Same maps? apart from a few ""changes"". All you'll get in the 2nd part is abysmal story telling, Item/npc placement more questions than answers.. IT ADDS ABSOLUTELY NO VALUE.. Maybe a reason for the ""B Part"" was without it the game would've taken 5 hours to pass? Who knows?

Long story short: I would still play the original over this reimagined RE2 if I had to choose one so, for me, this failed.

-The balance between new and familiar is what makes a great remake, and the first RE Remake that came out in 2002 perfectly achieved that: they added new rooms and maps, new puzzles, relocated items and enemies, tweaked certain areas, etc. but the overall map layout was still familiar. That balance here has been ruined. Beyond the amazing recreation of the RPD, the remaining areas of the game have nothing to do with what they were in the original. They didn't expand those areas, they didn't improve them, they outright destroyed the original map layouts and rebuilt them in a totally different way. Only a very few rooms of the sewers, factory and lab remained as simple cameos, and even they aren't even located where they should be. Other than that, this game gives a crap about all the areas but the RPD, they are just completely unrecognizable. Birkin's lab is not here, it's just a whole different place called ""NEST"" which also happens to be a lab.

-The Zapping System, a key aspect of the original RE2, has been removed. Now this barely has a ""2nd Run"" option which is supposed to emulate the B scenarios, but in truth, 1st and 2nd runs in this game aren't even consistent with each other so it's pointless, you still have Claire and Leon fighting exactly the same bosses in exactly the same magically restored places (except for two bosses that are Claire/Leon exclusive respectively) and you have a certain character showing up alive in the 2nd run after seeing that same character clearly die in your 1st run. So the original handled this much better.

-Another downside is that this reimagining has less enemies than the original game. Infected spiders and crows have been removed, and the Ivies/Poison Ivies have been replaced with lame zombies with a grass re-skin. And whoever tries to defend this thing by arguing that crows and spiders, or the giant moth, weren't interesting enemies, well, go play the RE1 Remake and see if that game removed crows, spiders, bees or Neptunes. They didn't. If an enemy ""wasn't interesting in the original"" then ""reimagine"" it and make it more interesting, since that's the point of reimagining, isn't it? Rearranging and changing things is fine and welcomed, but outright removing enemies that were in the original is total BS.

-And where the F- is the ""soundtrack"" of this game?... other than bosses, Mr. X, and Hunk/Tofu themes there is no music for pretty much the entire game, so essentially the only way to enjoy the music is by buying the 1998 Soundtrack DLC and playing with that.

-Ada and Sherry sections are boring. They're longer than in the original RE2, but beyond the first time are a chore to play through and just serve to extend gameplay length: basically just hack fans and other devices while avoiding zombies (Ada) or run/hide from old psycho trying to chase you (Sherry).

All that said, I do think it's a good and solid game on its own, and even a great Survival Horror, but I can't judge this as just another game because this dares to call itself ""Resident Evil 2"". It's not a faithful Remake like the first RE was, which is essentially the same but expanded and better, this new RE2 reimagined for modern audiences is just a whole different game, that plays different and -especially in the late game- feels like a travesty of RE2. It has just changed way too much.

I like the new additions to combat that make fighting things more interesting, the weapon upgrade mechanics, the new and reworked puzzles, the amazing RPD redesign that looks new but is still the RPD, but that's it. RE1 Remake completely updated and replaced the original game for me, it was I liked plus more and better. But this is not happening here, some things I liked are still here and well done, but some others are gone or were handled better 20 years ago, so I still prefer the original. If this was a brand new episode in the RE franchise, rather than a new game trying to capitalize on the RE2 nostalgia and milking Leon, Claire and the Raccoon City incident for the 15th time for the sake of fan-service, I would be giving this a positive review, but as it is I just can't.

The game looks amazing, works and if you use a controller you will love it. If you use a mouse+keyboard however, currently there is forced mouse acceleration just like in the demo and there is no way to remove it. It's a shame because it ruins an otherwise amazing port. If it get's fixed I can whole heartedly recommend it and will go into more details but at it stands, a pc game releasing with such bad mouse input is unacceptable.

And before someone says ""you should be playing it with a controller"" no, the original released on PC aswell as playstation. Not everyone bought this game to have a playstation nostalgia trip.

The game's engine also does not like the steam overlay at all. It will randomly lock caps lock on when it isn't on meaning you reply to friends in all caps and the worst of it is it will sometimes lock up the entire keyboard. If this happens and you haven't saved in a while and the auto save didn't save recently then that's alot of time wasted. This issue is also present in the HD remaster of the original and resident evil 0 games which is what leads me to believe it is an engine issue.

EDIT: Upon further playing I wouldn't recommend the game off a gameplay standpoint. The game is amazing until you reach a point where there is an enemy that does not stop chasing you down. This would be fine if the game then didn't continuously spawn a creature that is basically unkillable and requires you to sneak past them throughout the map where they previously weren't there (lickers). This means you need to run away from this creature chasing you but you can't run when you get to these other creatures causing unfair deaths that you have 0 control over. They either need to make it so shooting the character that never stops chasing you stuns him for longer than 20s, or make it so the lickers can be killed in less than 10 shotgun shots to the face. This a cheap way to kill you and unless you have died from it in a prior playthrough, there is no way to counter this.",Not Recommended," January 26, 2019"

Fan of Resident Evil Movies = Check, Fan of Walking Dead = Check, General Zombie Fan = Not so much, Horror Movie Fan = Not at all, Fan of Action Puzzle Story Games = Not so much. You probably need to check the boxes I don't to love this game. Didn't realize it was a remake until looking at reviews but now I know why it was so familiar. Don't recall how far I got last time but I know I didn't finish the game (And it is supposedly very short). No nostalgia therefore for me here either since I barely remember it.

The two things I can't get past. First it takes up to 7 bullets (randomly) to kill a zombie at normal level. A few unlucky moments and you are now out of ammo. Oh and it's not like you can just grab a cash register or metal pipe like in the real world, you are just stuck and have to die no matter how many potential weapons are around you.

And that leads to problem two. It's a game of go around and every door is locked, every thing is disabled until you figure out the exact right sequence to get through this door now and go back with this item for that one and so on. Sure there might be a second option here or there but your kidding yourself if you feel like your actually figuring anything real out. The first big puzzle has you getting the initials of several police officers by looking over paperwork or something to that effect. Just not my kind of fun.

The spooky factor works pretty well here though. At least at the police station portion of the early game you spend much of it wandering around dimly lit hallways with a pretty weak flashlight. Zombies come out of nowhere and the previously mentioned random death amount has you never sure they aren't still going to get up and get you. If only you could actually just run past any of them. This is suppose to be the theory and probably works great once you've memorized the gameplay, but I just don't know where I am suppose to go, what little item I'm suppose to find and pickup to be able to move forward on the prescribed path. So I must be slow and examine everything so as not to miss the one thing or place I need and therefore I have to end up killing nearly any and every zombie. And replay the same sequence endlessly to drag out the game length to something that should feel reasonable if your the sort of person that likes replaying the same thing (which I'm not).

So I run out of ammo randomly, and die because I can't pickup a sharp metal stick thats only a part of the background.

Great game, but the tyrant ruins the game experience. It is a very cool feature (and scary) in the start, but by the time the 2nd playthough gets going, it just becomes tedious having to constantly deal with solving puzzles and dodging him. It's an unneeded time buffer as you it doesn't really add anymore element to the game other than having to back track constantly and use consumables, which makes it seem like it was a tacked-on feature to make the game longer.

Ammo is in very short supply which is fine, but it took 13 headshots to drop a zombie. There are times you can't avoid them.

Game is clearly meant to have music since when you BUY THE OG SOUNDTRACK, the music transitions fine between combat, rooms, etc. Now onto this being sold on PC. No walk button, and the game tells you to sneak past lickers. Well you have to trial and error to find out that on PC, you either have to use a controller, or you AIM AND WALK to make no noise. Wow, how intuitive. Now they also have a limited number of uses on your knife, and that includes attack, not just countering a grapple. That's fun... So much for saving ammo. Now speaking of ammo as well, headshots are pointless. Apparently the meta is to shoot legs off and go around zombies. That makes sense considering you are using 9mm hollowpoints at point blank. That'd do a lot of damage to the brain and brain stem.
I have shot a zombie in the head 8 times. 4 times each time it got up. Left the room thinking it was dead and just being flat out tired of wasting ammo. I come back and it's alive again with no damage to the head. And yes, I am letting the crosshair close each time.
Supposedly the game does this because of some kind of dynamic difficulty system. The game still has finite ammo points so they should not do that. Keep headshots consistent. If it's 3-4 each zombie then they stay down? Fine. Having to use 8-12+ on ONE zombie? Not acceptable.
I was having fun up until recently on this. I got too good at headshotting zombies apparently so the game punished me.
Valve approved my refund so that's cool. Update on the lickers and stealth. You are not supposed to wait once they are alerted to your sounds. Goes against every stealth game I've played with blind enemies in it. Normally a single small sound will make an enemy look, but not walk over. What you do on here, is just keep walking past them before they start walking. Lets be ""sneaky"", by making more noise just continuing to walk past them.
What would make more sense to me, is that them, having good hearing, hearing a continuous noise starting to go past them, would actually alert and make them attack.
The stealth here... Totally intuitive and logical...
Oh and to make this clear, as a kid, like up until 12 or so, I played the original RE games and completed them. I am a fan of the series. Those games were harder than this. Ok so why can't I beat this, or just gave up on it? Because artificial difficulty like auto balancing in this game, isn't real difficulty, it's bad design. Old RE games had good design where everything fit together well. The difficulty in those games was real difficulty.

Though the game itself isn't bad, there are obvious troubles, such as the optimization. To be precise, there are mysterious fps drops at some points of the game, and the reason behind that is unknown. Another issue with the game is its concept: the flouncing around really annoying locations and constantly searching for something (frequently even having to rush to same exact place several times) could be getting on nerves. On the contrary, I know that some players like this game exactly for that ""polishing"" of locations, and thorough gameplay. Nevertheless, the approach that had been taken to RE7 seemed to be far better, both in terms of telling the plot, as well as in the overall unobtrusiveness of the game.",Not Recommended, April 5

It's not a bad game, it has a lot of good, but for 60 bucks...can't recommend.

I loved RE:2 as a kid, I haven't replayed it in a long time.

The graphics and sound in this game are stellar.

However, overall playing it just feels, meh. It feels like the entire game is super focused on memorizing it via multiple playthroughs to get the fastest time possible. That might be fun for some, but not really for me.

Combat is just tedious, hit detection doesn't make sense, sometimes you get a 1 shot headshot kill, other times it takes 5 headshots. Non-zombie enemies like the licker also sometimes die in a single high power round, other times it takes 2-3.

absolutely everything in this game has a set static location, which again, means 0 replayability, unless speed runs appeal to you.

Gimme Gimmicks

I was pretty sure I was going to love it.

First I'm a huge fan of the original, it was the very first game that I played.
It was the first game that I thoroughly finished, searching through every nooks and crannies to get all the lore and goodies.
I quite liked RE7, I loved the visceral ambience, the engine and the writing.
Finally I tried the 20 minutes demo they released a few month prior to launch, I must say it looked good and the controls felt smooth.

Considering all these good experiences I was confident this was a game I was going to enjoy. So I did something I rarely do I didn't wait for an interesting sale to come around, I paid the full 60 bucks.

Now that I have played and finished it, I must say I'm a bit disapointed. I barely hyped myself as I try not to do reading almost no articles about the game, just catching a glimpse of the good press it seems to have.

Individualy many elements are functioning well : good engine, good graphics, aiming and shooting mechanics feel good.

It's only when you take a global look at the overhaul of the game that it shows it's weaknesses.



Never in the game I ever felt stressed with the vibe it gave, no latent pressure, no anguish while opening a door, no well timed unpredictible zombie entries. In it's stead I was just annoyed of another soaking bullet ennemies, and when I couldn't bother anymore, just another route planing to avoid those graby hands. Never have I met a situation where the game encouraged me to think out of the box or be creative or challenged me to make bold actions.

I have the strange feeling that these short comings were partly known during developpement, that would explain the addition of this stupid tyrant ( one of the most blatant short comings of the game ).
I believe he was meant to insert that feeling of anxiety, that ennemy that you're powerless against.
Truth is you might get that feeling when you first meet him until you realised it's becomes just an annoying gimmick very quickly, just as zombies times 10. Run the opposite direction until you loose him until your next encounter, at that point it's just rince and repeat : he randomly pops in the room you're in, you flee, you resume the exploration of the room you were in. The only times it managed to hit me were the times he stood just in front of the door I was exiting, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•slapped me and there goes the pointless chase ( I couldn't help but here the benny hill chase theme in my head during those chases).
It appears you can mod him out of the game. I would personally recommend that, still it wouldn't make the game better for me.


The characters are poorly written, they have no chemistry.
Not once I told myself .
Not once I felt that sense of dread while walking through the streets of Racoon City.
Not once I felt invested with and overarching goal that The protagonists had to reach, and it shows in the objectives. It's just as the quest log is, you just work your way through the next puzzle over and over.

Ada took a big blow, if like me you remember a mysterious femme fatal with a hidden agenda you will be disapointed.
Leon a rookie police officer must be a huge nerd cause he barely flinches at the site of zombies and takes it like just another day at work ( well none of his dialogues shows that he is taken aback).
Same thing goes for Claire and her interactions.
Basicaly those characters had apparently such involvement in the story that I would find that them just turning tail and quitting Racoon much more believable.

It's almost has if you were supposed to be involved with the characters taking into account all of the previous entries in they took part of. For a reboot it makes absolutly no sense.




They are many aspects I haven't mentioned ( for exemple boss fights are stale ), either I just forgot them either they are just not strikingly good or bad.
Still after I finished the game I was a tad disapointed.

I wouldn't say it is a bad game or that it has to be avoided.

I would just caution RE2 fans that you may not get a good nostalgic feeling out of this game.
To everyone else, it may serve as a pass time with a pretty significant price reduction, still I'm pretty sure you can find a better game to play. This entry in the RE saga is unecessary.",Not Recommended," April 11, 2019"

YouTube‚Ñ¢ Video: Resident Evil 2 (2019) buggy, unplayable 
Views: 97
After getting the Spade Key, I went back to the police station lobby for a cutscene. Marvin shows me a video of Claire stuck outside, tells me to go upstairs through the waiting room to get to where...


Game bugs out, unplayable for me. i9, 32Gb DDR4, RTX 2070 8Gb (all drivers up to date) beats the recommended. Game worked fine up until the cutscene showing Claire at the door to the station. I can't walk through doorways now (can't exit the main hall/lobby cell), and if I unequip my gun, it does not come back when equiping it again. Started a new save, this happened again at the same point.

I don't know if the game doesn't like my hardware, something with my software, or if there is a choice I keep making wrong in this game that sets off this glitch. Whatever it is, it persists through multiple saves.

I hate to downvote this game, I love original RE2, and this remake looks amazing and was a lot of fun. But for it to be so broken to be unplayable, I have to warn others. Will change this once Capcom sorts it out. Probably just going to buy it on PS4.",Not Recommended," January 26, 2019"

An ambitious remake that ends up being disappointing, tedious and frustrating.
As a long-time fan of the series, I had high hopes for this, but was sorely let down.

****SPOILERS AHEAD****

[PROS]
1: Graphically stunning, the finest film-quality animation & detailed environments / characters I've ever seen. Unfortunately they're not very well optimized (as was the Street Fighter V problem), and I can't appreciate them, as my laptop (MSI GE63 Raider) starts heating up unless I keep the fans on high and turn the graphics down so far that I may as well be playing the original Resident Evil 2. For those of you with a space-age computer that can run this on max, I cannot sing this game's graphical praises enough.

2: One scene where you play as Sherry, where I had more survival horror fun in 10-15 minutes than the rest of the entire game combined.

3: Ties in some story aspects that were retconned in later games, explaining SOME of the lore a bit better than the original did. For example, Irons' death was handled much better in this remake.

4: Very good writing in that entire orphanage section; I actually got a little emotional reading some of the diaries & notes.

5: I definitely approve of the new unlockables, and how they were done. Such as the S.T.A.R.S armoury, safe deposit room etc., these are a nice little side objective to break up the overall monotony.

6: Puzzles etc. are done nicely, not as hard as RE1 but not as easy as RE0. I felt a reasonable challenge, although I would've liked more things that rely on Examining & Combining.

[CONS]
1: Physics & lighting bugs, such as Claire's ponytail frequently spazzing out for no reason, or resetting its position after every single cutaway. There are also problems with shadows freaking out if you walk up to walls holding a flashlight, and several instances of zombies & corpses flailing or getting stuck in walls / doors.

2: Several story elements you could examine in the original have been removed, such as the desks in the S.T.A.R.S office. This didn't need to be removed, and little details like this were nice in the original, letting us learn a little more about the characters.

3: Gameplay is obnoxiously tedious & frustrating.
You cannot get around zombies unless they're already looking away and you don't need to get by them; there's no way to sneak or dodge their attacks.
The point of classic Resident Evil, and survival horror in general, is saving your resources such as bullets unless you absolutely need to fight. In this game, you can't reasonably do that, as zombies will lunge several feet and grab you almost every single time.
Unless you happen to have a knife or grenade handy, zombies become less of a reasonable obstacle, and more of a toll booth where you have to pay some of your health to continue. And on normal, there is no reason it should take up to 10 headshots to bring down some zombies, wasting ammo.
In many cases, any attempt to avoid zombies becomes a game of musical chairs, luring them in circles to have any hope of continuing with your current task.
Mr. X is much faster than his original incarnation, too, and due to the game not having ""closed environments"" anymore, he can follow you anywhere, apart from a select few safe locations. Luring him away from your destination barely helps, as the moment he loses sight of you, he starts homing in on the area you need to get to next, patrolling there.
And if you beat him there? And didn't waste ammo killing zombies prior? Good luck, because as soon as you run, shoot or get attacked, Mr. X will hear you and come running, meaning you have to start the process over again.
All these issues could be resolved with a simple Dodge button, even if it has to rely on timing. Or possibly stealth takedowns, such as slitting zombies' throats from behind.
Frankly I find it weird that despite copy-pasting Claire's outfit from Revelations 2, Capcom took zero lessons from what made that game the perfect balance of the classic & modern games.
And forget that battle with William and the crane; 9 times out of 10 he WILL hit you, no matter what you do.
You cannot expect to create a survival horror experience that requires you to constantly waste resources and tank damage.
Also Lickers - it's a nice idea to be able to sneak around them as they're blind, however it quickly falls apart when you realize they're homing in on you anyway, which in tight spaces means there's not really much difference other than you having the chance to attack first, which - again - you HAVE to.

4: The entire sewer section and how they went overboard with... certain details. That was just disgusting, and completely uncalled for.

5: No indication of exactly what the differences in handguns are, apart from clip size. You have to experiment to work out what does what, and unless you save scum, this means wasting even MORE precious ammo.

6: The obvious: Unnecessary redesigns. It's fine if you want to make new character outfits, but don't make them the default and change what was already fine, especially when the DLC outfits just look stupid.
Although, as annoyed as I am with the unnecessary changes to Claire's classic outfit (removing her undershirt) I do appreciate the humour in the new outfits apparently pandering to the SJW / feminist crowd (which had me worried that my favourite franchise was about to succumb to that poisonous cult), while the classic Claire outfit has been made even MORE sexualized. Good bait-and-switch, but I still hope someone mods the classic Claire outfit to be as it was supposed to be.
With Sherry's uniform, I agree the new one is better, but her hair did not need changing.
And don't think I didn't notice Annette now having the ""dead mom"" hairstyle, a common anime trope.

7: Also a bug where the full-screen will exit if you get a Steam achievement. A minor concern but still quite irritating, so I have to play in windowed instead.

====

Overall, I went through the whole game just feeling annoyed, like I was only continuing to justify the money I spent on the preorder. At no time was I scared, immersed or having fun, apart from that one scene in the orphanage.
A shame, too, because with just a few minor tweaks & additions, and removing some of the unnecessary ones, this could've been a great game.
Personally I'll return to having fun with RE6 & Operation Raccoon City; I cannot recommend this remake for anything other than curiosity, or as an example of how NOT to redo a classic.

Maybe when some mods come out that let you play with the classic outfits from the start (and they've been fixed) or there's actually a way to dodge zombies and conserve ammo, I could consider recommending this, but as it stands, it's just annoying.",Not Recommended," January 26, 2019"

*SPOILERS* This game is Terrible... the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th play-throughs.
The First time is great, Amazing even, and you enjoy it a Lot. Scary, Narrow hallways, and some Tense puzzles that make you think twice about going for that gunpowder; However, when you play it again, even as your 2nd Run as the Other protagonist, and you start to see Very Blatant Flaws with the game that only get worse and worse.

What do you think when you play as the other protagonist? Things will be different? You fight different enemies? You do different things? No. None of these. It is Literally just a copy-paste of the First playthrough, just doing Your Specific character's Storyline. Otherwise, you fight the Same boss not 1, not 2, not 3 times, but 6+1 times! 6, then 7 times! It Is Insane. Who designed this game? Lazy people that's who, that may have given you an Amazing experience the First time, but Immediately on the 2nd run you realize that things are Not as they Seem, or Should be. You just repeat the Same steps as you Already did, except another storyline which is, of course, appreciated, but when you are doing Exactly the same things with only the Slightest changes to the plot, it becomes a Tedious Chore.

And the 3rd playthrough... Oh HoHo Oh you poor Fool. you Ignorant, silly, Fool. You think it will be the opposite right? If you choose Claire instead of Leon on your 3rd time, you think that Claire meets that cop guy, finds Ada Wong, and has to escape the facility while saving Ada, right? Like any Normal person would assume? WROOONG!!!! It is Exactly the same as before with Both people doing the Same storyline. Leon Never meets the girl, Claire Never meets Ada, and it is Identical to the 2nd run and all that other crap, again with the Slightest, only Slightest changes to the plot.. Again! It Is Insane! The Betrayal, Disappointment, and Let-Down is complete. I didn't even bother playing it a 3rd time, because it was pointless. I already did those things, and I would have to fight that Same boss another 3 times, then 4 times, Again. My Resent was complete, and I realized that my excitement was met with Stewie Griffin saying, ""Ah.. tsk Tsk Tsk... Life isn't what you thought it would be.""

Capcom's remake of this classic is modernized but far from modern. The graphics are improved but not up to today's standards. The controls are better than the original but still feel clunky and movement is stilted. It's also an extremely low effort PC port, having not even enabled mouse support for some of the in game puzzles, forcing you to navigate buttons with a keyboard.

This is a great game. The perfect balance of cheesiness and horror that I know and love from the Resident Evil series. It is a brilliant return to form for the series. I would call it a perfect game.

However, I would not recommend getting the PC version. This port is awful - graphics settings that lie about their VRAM usage, buggy broken settings that seem to work paradoxically (why on earth does it run better at High (2GB) than Medium??), and frame stuttering no matter what settings its on - it drops every few seconds by 15 frames. Not to mention the game randomly drops to 3-5 frames a second, causing my entire rig to chug horrendously for up to a minute before it stops.
Ports of this low quality should not be acceptable anymore. Get it on a console, you'l have a better experience.

Scary, but appallingly balanced.

Resi 2 is one of the most atmospheric games I've played: combining creeping horror and jump scares all around. Unfortunately, it also retains the crappy inventory management system of the original game, and the unrealistically low availability of ammunition. I don't mind being scared, I do mind being presented with a no-win situation due to a lack of ammunition and no effective mele√© weapons, resulting in the game devolving into frustration as you get hunted down and slaughtered by fast enemies (or just slow zombies that you have to bypass but can't due to narrow corridors) because you've run out of ammo.",Not Recommended, January 12

With all the hype, someone has to say that the boss battles in this game are bad. The movement is too clunky, the animations of boss hits are the same HUMONGOUS sweeping arch that at times are literally impossible to avoid, there is no dodge button, and the final battle is actually the least ""cool"" in the entire game!

With how well everything else is done, this ruined it for me. Not to mention shooting zombies in the head 4 times to knock them down, then have them get back up LITERALLY 3 more times requiring 3 bullets per time. Quick math, that's 13 (pistol) bullets to take care of a single low-level walker zombie. That's ridiculous.

Sometimes you can get their head to pop open in one shot. How? Hell, I don't know. I've aimed in the right eye, the left eye, between the eyes, at the chin, through the mouth, in the nose, up on the forehead, and there is NO consistent way to get that critical shot. I've played more FPS's than anything else in my life, and this is beyond frustrating in a game where ammunition management is so important.

I really liked most of the gameplay, but my memory of the experience will be marred by the fact that the boss fights were so frustratingly bad. Show me a single let's-player that HASN'T been ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in a boss fight because YOU CAN'T DODGE THAT! And at the end of them, you don't feel like, ""Yeah, what an accomplishment! I really figured that one out!"" You just feel like, ""Thank God that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-show is over and I HAPPENED to make it out that time,"" and that's just not good execution.

Bit slow moving, but looks and sounds great.

It was okay until Mr X/Tyrant showed up. If I wanted to get shoved around tight corridors interrupted in what I was doing, I'd travel back in time to my school days.
Alot of padding in form of backtravel due especially to not knowing what object to keep with you at what point.
Leon's English voice actor sounds bored, rather than a rookie in over his head. Compare that to Marvin; he is fantastic and highly emotive. I have not fully experienced Claire's at the time of wrtiting this review.

All character models are nice though, with the exception of the usual weird looking mouth which gives the impression of a smile when it's supposed to be a painful grin or vice versa.

Characters motivations are often weird, like Ada Wong. She makes no sense whatsoever. Why high heels if you're a pro agent? Why not join forces at first meeting? Why talk about getting out of there, offer no help, walk away, only to later come back and be snobby about not leaving yet and not even attempt to listen to the problems about leaving? Trying to be dramatic for dramatic sake rather than actually being mysterious for organic reasons, she just comes off as an ignorant a-hole.

On a tech design level, I love that you don't have to climb actively but rather just walk onto a ladder to activated climbing. I wish there was fast travel though. But I love that items that have no more use are ticked off.

Completed the game as Leon and was looking forward to playing a Claire so I could see what she was up to while Leon was in the station. On the store page it says: ""Enjoy separately playable campaigns for both Leon and Claire, allowing players to see the story from both characters‚Äô perspective.""
That's a lie. You don't experience the story from both characters perspective. You play the same story only that some items, enemy placement and some cutscenes are changed but you're still doing the same thing in the same place as the other character. There is no B story

My biggest issue with the game was a graphical glitch I had (I wasn't the only one).
Things ran very smootly, very well optimised but there was a problem with the lightning. Light sources barely gave of any light, sometimes nothing at all, There were parts I was compeltely stuck in darkness and couldn't progress and cutscenes were literally pitch black, could barely make out what was going on.
I spent maybe a combined time of 2-3 hours trying to fix this while still trying to play the game, and I found a work around. To fix the issue I had to turn my video quality down to 70%, so the game looked really bad but I could actually see what's around me. This pretty much ruined my first time experience with the game

Please be aware there is some strong negative mouse acceleration that causes the camera to move very fast when physically moving the mouse slowly and move slower when you flick the mouse very quickly. This is obviously terrible in a horror game where you may need to suddenly turn around and can cause serious motion sickness, as it does with me. There is a slider in-game to control the negative acceleration but, currently, when it is turned to its lowest setting, the acceleration is not turned off and is actually very prominent. I will gladly switch this review to positive if this is fixed as the rest of the game is fantastic so far.

I liked the first 3 hours. Visuals look ok, however TAA antialiasing and vignetting degrade the picture quality too much. Gameplaywise, after 4 hours in, I don't like it that much anymore. Enemies become too strong. The adaptive difficulty was holding me on a nice pressure point in the beginning, but now it seems unplayable, therefore I change the review to not recommended. I might re-evaluate later. Restarting with a lower difficulty now (cannot just change without starting all over). It seems the adaptivity is not adaptive enough.

Update: After having finished Leon's campaign now, I am not that much negative anymore, rather neutral. The game can be enjoyed, as long as you comply into the ruleset and demands that could be seen as outdated given todays general gaming expectations:
- Not being able to change difficulty while the campaign is in progress
- Essential graphic options missing
- Restricted progress save options (however, some might enjoy this or deem this as an essential part of the gaming experience)
- Instead of being outright clear about the rules and game mechanics (for example, telling the player what he is supposed to do), it feels like in the 80ies where figuring out what to do and where have been part of the game (sometime because of developers' laziness and to make the game take longer to finish, sometimes as design element or part of the game), and can be overcome only by either lots of experimenting (and dying while doing that) or looking up how each enemy / boss is best dealt with in which part of the game. While some might enjoy this aspect, I don't like to play ""guess what the developer wants you to do""
- The progress in the game relies heavily on memorization: What to do where and when. Most prominent part of your grade that you receive at the end is based on the time you needed. Most weapon unlocks rely on speed running, therefore requiring you to having memorized the routes.
- The emphasis on memorization goes even so far that you have to memorize a code given in unkown symbols you see in one spot of the game and apply at another spot. I mean, screenshot or draw the thing yourself and done. Or memorize. Applying the code is easy as long as you remember it (by whatever way), but why make easy things so complicated? I expected a horror survival shooter and not a memory game.
- Following from the emphasis on memory is that shooter skills are pretty much not needed here: Fast reactions and fast pinpoint accuray in aiming are not required. Overall, I would categorize the game as an adventure with limited item inventory and action elements.
So, if you don't mind the aformentioned rules of the game and game mechanics, it is worth the full price. If you expected something else, either by having enjoyed RE 5,6,7 and Relevations 1&2, or playing the demo of this here, rather wait for a price drop or spend your money somewhere else.

Reviewing Resident Evil 2 is difficult and just goes to show how flawed the review system is on steam. Despite my marking this game as 'no' for recommended, I want to preface this review with this: this game is by no means a bad game. It's good, it can be fun to play. My complaints stem from so many small details and complaints that, piled up, makes the game a chore for me to personally trek through.

First off, game mechanics. I understand the need to make zombies more impervious to attacks to build the suspense and horror but in a game where you're supposed to avoid them, it is very annoying to be running and a zombie take up 15 bullets (sometimes more) in one go. Headshots being RNG isn't great and though you can take out their limbs and have a better time to maneuver around them after doing so, it's still extremely frustrating. I should be able to clear a room and not have to worry about those same zombies getting right back up.

I had a case where even though I boarded up the hallway, I walked into a room. Two lickers. Mr. X behind me. And then a zombie in the middle of the hallway. I was screwed no matter what I did. Walking meant the lickers wouldn't hear me but Mr. X walks faster than I do. Running, I will get murdered by the lickers yet get out of Mr. X's range. I opted for the second and though I managed to just narrowly avoid a licker's sweep, the zombie around the corner got me, licker followed up, and then Mr. X finished me off.

That's honestly all I have to complain about where gameplay mechanics are concerned so I would say that's a good thing and goes to show how polished the game is.

Scenery, though, is something else I need to talk about. I'm a long time fan of the RE series so when I heard about this game, I was thoroughly excited (though that lessened and became worry after RE7 and how it was handled). When entering the game, I had hoped to feel nostalgia. I didn't. No space except maybe the save room just under the stairs and that one room you open up with the knife where you see the licker walk across the window really gave me any sense of nostalgia. I didn't feel like I was playing RE2 at all.

And something strange about this game. I didn't feel like the ""stages"" were separated enough. In the original game, the RPD, the sewer, and the lab all felt like different ""levels"". Here, I felt like everything bled together and I feel it's mostly because of the color pallets and lighting choices in the game. It gave me eye fatigue and made me tired after only one hour playing and that's not something any other game's given me before.

Finally, my biggest gripe in this game. Story.

Claire's scenario was undoubtedly the best. Annette's changes were for the better, I feel, and Claire - a character I have never really cared for story-wise in the past games - is strongly written. It's great. Leon's scenario, however, was an utter disappointment. Though I appreciate the changes made to side characters like Kendo, Ben, it's the other characters i have a problem with. Leon's scenario was always my favorite to play in the original for a very specific reason: Ada Wong. I don't mind her story change. The FBI front makes sense and works. It's her manner of speech and approach to things. This isn't Ada Wong but some cheap imitation.

And then the Leon and Ada relationship. It's poorly written and even the classic game managed to make it seem more natural than this. How are we supposed to believe that Ada is that ""woman he can't let go"" from later installments when they spent even less time together than in the original and 85% of it was her berating him verbally? It's ridiculous.

All in all, it isn't a terrible game. Can be fun. But other things, small things, make me want to just uninstall and revisit this maybe once every 10 years. It was not worth the wait, personally.",Not Recommended," February 16, 2019"

I have played many horror games.. I had never loved them, but I absolutely fell in love with horror games since I've played The Evil Within 1.

What I absolutely love about horror games is that most of them tell such an intriguing story that it sucks you in... On top of that the adrenaline of several zombies chasing you trying to eat your brains out is a pretty cool feeling.
But what makes a great horror game is the atmosphere of the game. You're not scared because there might be a jump scare, but you're scared because of your environment and the creepy things happening within it.. You might not know what creature lurks around the corner...

This game is quite the opposite however. EVERY scary part of this, is well, jump scares. You literally cannot leave an area without a zombie popping out of the ceiling or a zombie randomly grabbing you after opening a door... It's like you have to literally walk around slow motion with your volume lowered and your eyes squinted because around every corner the music gets drastically loud and something pops up.

Jump scares is not what makes a horror game good, and unfortunately I can't give this game a great rating because of that. I'm a huge fan of RE, I loved the last game and many games before. I couldn't wait for this one to come out too, but the game play is all about jump scares and that really ruined the experience for me.

I'll recommend it if someone doesn't care about jump scares, but if someone wants to be freaked out by the environment rather than zombies jump scaring you, I'd recommend the evil within.",Not Recommended," March 11, 2019"

Good and bad...

I like the look and feel overall. As a game designer, I have my critiques like the water is too wet like everything is covered in vegetable oil. Cloth physics are nice but a little too fluttery and things clip through the model which is easily preventable in this day in age. But that's just the aesthtics.

Gameplay...

This...honestly is clunky as hell. I stopped playing after getting past the film developing room because I was sick of not being able to push/shake the zombies off--a feature that has been in every RE game--if you get grabbed, just sit back because there's nothing you can do.

The Knife...
Why is this even in the game? I can't slash the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing zombies with it because the hitbox is so touchy or non-existant. It doesn't matter if they are standing or lying on the ground. The only thing I can do is wait till the bastard grabs me and use the stab option--but that's not a kill, no the knife just gets stuck with no other way to fight the damn things off. What's the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing point?

No stomp?
Why can't I stomp zombies that are on the ground or biting my legs? This has always been a thing in RE games but not anymore appearently. The ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• just stands there and gets eaten.

Should you buy?
That's up to you but I want a refund, personally.

Update: Am I still playing?
For the moment because I paid $69.99 and I'm stubborn. However, I am still frustrated. Everything above is still true, but I've changed my strategy for playing. I don't kill anything. It takes too much ammo--seriously, even headshots sometimes takes 6 or 7 handgun bullets or 3 to 4 from the shotgun. I'm on standard, if you're curious. So here's what I do: I save, explore a room. If I get bit, I reload then run through the room and grab only what is needed--rinse and repeat. Since saving doesn't hurt your S rank, I guess it is ok.

The Final Nail in the Coffin!
That's it, it's official. I have refunded the game. FK them. About halfway through a standard game, the difficulty switched to ""Assisted"" basically Easy-Mode. Appearently it's an option if you die or reload enough times. This switch is permanent. It doesn't matter if you load from a previous save before the switch either. It changes the game state which means you'll have to restart from a new game if you accidentally click yes--like I did--when it prompts at the loading screen. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• this game!

I really like this game. A lot -- and I would recommend it. Everything is excellent, except one glaring thing that needs to be fixed:

The lighting has a lot of visual bugs. I've tried multiple fixes -- From what I can see, the lighting is coded to activate when you enter a room -- for dramatic effect. However, It doesn't trigger off of Leon's (or Clair's) model, it triggers off the camera behind the shoulder. This causes a lot of really jarring lighting transisitions (for example, if you place your back anywhere close to a wall, all lighting will vanish from the room, even if you can see the lighting 'lit'). This can result in a lot of strobiing effects that are very immersion breaking.

Unfortunately Resident Evil 2 Remake is very disappointing if your a fan of the original game.

Some of the best content has been completely stripped out and replaced with nothing, mainly the A/B scenarios where both playable characters have there own unique campaign depending on who you play as first.

The main characters themselves (Leon & Claire), have been changed so much as to become unrecognizable from there original betters, both act like children at times (Claire mostly) as if nothing is going on around them or just use an abundance of foul language to show some sense of fear at their ""inconvenient"" situation. Neither really feel like real people and that's saying something when you look back at the original voice acting and lines of dialogue and how campy it all was.

Long story short you'll play it trough once, see that there isn't much to do after and uninstall.

While not as bad as RE 5 and 6, this has none of the subtle value of either the original or the amazing recent RE Revelations 2.
- Pacing is completely destroyed in the name of increasing difficulty. Don't get me wrong, survival horror requires the real threat of death, but Mr. X might as well be a tattoo on your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• - he never isn't right next to you. And like sound volume, if it's always at level 10, there is no contrast to compare it too. Just an obnoxious normal that never lets you get comfortable enough to be scared.
- Exploration in much of the game is impossible. The threats are just too numerous and consistent to do anything but the immediate objective which makes the game painfully linear compared to the original.
- Arbitrary nonsense (like the Combat knife at the end of Jill's campaign), cannot be excused - period.
Is it pretty? Yes, but once that wears off, how long will people still value this game?? Only time will tell. Sadly, R.E. is devolving into The Evil Within.

It hurts to not recommend this game. The optimization is good, the graphics are good, the story is good and the puzzles are logical and not just about fine sweeping every nook and cranny.

But I'll never recommend a game that use control stick input, instead of including proper mouse input. It's tweaked enough for the game to be playable with M+K, high sensitivity users might not even notice it. That's how well it's tweaked. But for me and many others that use a little lower sensitivity it's just doesn't work properly.

If they fix it, this game will be one of those must haves on the PC.",Not Recommended," February 1, 2019"

then i realize i neede to put direct x11 in video settings,it was defoult on directx12
ok

warning you will have to rush this game even if you don't enjoy doing so, due to a silly mechanic in the game. For me immersion in the game is really important, I like to take my time, and check out the surroundings the atmosphere, Mr X ruins this for me, it made me stop playing, i don't like games that you have to run like a headless chicken, just to complete it, why would I want to do this in a game i enjoy, if i enjoy something i would want to take my time, Mr X just takes the fun out of the game for me. if you are like me and enjoy games that are at a slower pace this game is not for you, due to mr x you will have to rush the whole game.... and he is not even scary or anything, its just tedious to run from him, ""oooh i know a great idea, lets create this unkillable slow enemy, that is not scary or anything, but just would prevent you from staying in the same room for 5 secs, you have to run 3 rooms away hhahah, this is funny and would make the game sooo great hahah, the feeling as if you forgot a pizza in the oven hahhhahah and you have to run hahahha"" this is what they were thinking when they made mr x. ggwp",Not Recommended," March 15, 2019"

Honestly, for 80 bucks i really expected alot more out of this game. It took me 7 hours to beat leon's campaign going as slow as possible, exploring every nook and cranny. was it a fun 7 hours? yes it was awesome, the boss fights were epic and the game gives you just enough resources to survive without being a pro. So i fire up claire's campaign..... its exactly the same as leons, like 90% the same with tiny differences in the cut scenes and weaponry and you get some little girl instead of ada. One of the most annoying features in this game is the knife, its now a consumable that seems to break when you need it the most. The lack of shot gun shells is pretty annoying too, leons shot gun is basically useless the whole game because of it and its not even that much more powerful than his basic hand gun. Claires run is deffinately more fun though id say, because of the grenade launcher. plenty of ammo for it and it one shots lickers. If this game were 30 - 40 bucks i would definitely give it a thumbs up, but its no where near 80 bucks worth of content.",Not Recommended," February 2, 2019"

It's a very good game, but it has 2 big snafus that severly hampers it:

-Mr.X implementation is trash, when he appears mid-game his gameplay is inadapted for the game and it ruins the fun for the duration of his presence.
-Scenario B is only 20% different than scenario A, very unlike original RE2.

Really wanted to like this game! It starts off really well but is majorly let down by a lack of intuitive game play. The original PS1 games were amazing, they were fair and you were gradually rewarded with weapons needed to deal with boss fights. Sadly in this version the games lack of intuition allows players to get ahead of themselves without collecting the weapons and ammo needed for boss fights. The game doesn't naturally lead you towards the weapons meaning massive frustration and having to repeat several hours of game play in order to go back and look for things. The original never did this. Such a shame..",Not Recommended," February 2, 2019"

Zombies deal far too much damage and ammo is incredibly scarce, even for this kind of game (I've completed all the original games multiple times since the day they launched so im no stranger to ammo conservation). police station feels ridiculously small. the game has this horrible grey filter over it. the surround sound is the only good part, the rain and sound effects in the first 15 minutes or so sound amazing but once you're in the police station the audio is just run of the mill. the sewer enemies are an absolute pain.

It's important to note that I already don't like remakes of good games, good games don't need to be remade, and RE 2 Remake simply didn't change my opinion.
Companies should focus on making a great game using and improving the same resources and mechanics of previous titles to deliver a new and better product, instead of hanging on the old and simply repackaging that.

Resident Evil 2 Remake is not simply a remake, that wouldn't be fair, the game does try to keep things fresh, but all of the additions made to make the game scarier and fit modern times simply never work. Monsters are far too spongy without adding additional difficulty over the original, this especially goes for the boss fights, making the already stupidly gimmicky boss fights even worse, and shooting zombies a tedious and annoying ordeal.
Zombies can barely be avoided, and while I understand that zombies were too easy to avoid in the original games, simply having to kil almost all the zombies that cross your path feels more like an action third person shooter rather than a survival horror title.
People praise this game for giving you little ammo, but I always felt like I was given more than enough to kill every single enemy in the game twice over, but that is generally just a personal thing.

It doesn't help that the Leo and Claire runs are practically the exact same with little alterations, making a second run feel like an even bigger slog to get through than it already was.
There's also little to no interaction between Leon and Claire either, so a second run is not necessary in the slightest.

The characters look terrible, their designs are atrocious, not only that but many of the more memorable characters are reduced to generic self-inserts, generic villains, and a source of film references. Nanette, which is the worst contender in this list, is completely turned into a generic bad wife and mother but great scientist trope, and on top of that her final redemption is stupid and undeserved, nor did it actually redeem her character in any way.

The new soundtrack is also terrible, generic banging drums and typical action sequence violins. The original soundtrack is available but only for those willing to pay an absurd amount of money for something that not only should entirely be in the game already, but should have been remastered and implemented if you're going to do a remake of the original anyway. It's not just the soundtrack, all of the alternative costumes are also sold to players through the store, instead of being free unlocks within the game like the original, which greatly lengthened that game's duration the right way.

I'm sorry but I didn't feel this one, but I'm glad many fans and newcomers did, don't get me wrong. There's definitely some changes I was on board with, but for the most part this did not manage to win me over. It's a good direction for Capcom to take the series, but it's also a worrisome one when Capcom puts so little focus on the future of Resident Evil, and so much on the past, especially when the past isn't being done justice. Capcom should stop milking the Racoon City era and the other initial outbreaks dry, and instead try and manage to tell a compelling story set after the foundations of the series, something they haven't managed since Code Veronica. I'm both worried and excited for the future of the franchise as a fan since the release of the second one in 1998, and I'm glad the series has moved away from things like co-op, ridiculous and grand storytelling, action sequences and arena fights, but I'm also worried that the franchise is now going to grow comfortable where they are and bring us more of that. Let's just hope they'll eventually manage to actually make something that I would want to play.",Not Recommended," February 23, 2019"

It starts off fun but the backtracking and RNG headshots ruin it. Theres not that much content either a survival mode would have been fun.

You will end up having to abandon saves and go back hours because of stuff like this which makes me not want to play the game.

Gonna keep this review short & unsweet. Yes, it's coming from a niche perspective. I had my doubts about getting it because of the lack of fixed camera angles. I should have stuck with my gut & stayed away. I literally can't play this game. I played over the shoulder games before, love the Dark Souls series. But this game has no lock on & the absolute worst control scheme I've ever had the misfortune to experience. Whenever I get anywhere near an enemy the camera either zooms into the enemies face/feet or my characters face/feet leaving me to run around slamming my characters head into the walls. Considering how many people wanted to see this done with fixed camera they could have at least given us lock ons.

Although I'm a fanboy of this franchise, In my personal opinion this game although very fun, is frustrating after you realize the unlockables are too hardcore to achieve (PUN INTENDED). Unlike previous games where it was fair and you weren't penalize for using special weapons in the higher difficulties to complete under 2 hours and 10 mins to get a S+ rank, this time around you are and there is a typewriter penalty. You can only save three times. Unless you are really good at not taking damage you will be smashing your keyboard against the wall with this one. One to two (depends on how the AI feels) bites from zombies in Hardcore mode will put you on danger and lets not even talk about Mr. X. Overall the typewriter penalty is what killed it for me. The game is good but I can't possibly recommend this for new players of this franchise because the replay value and weapons carry over is almost non existent. If this is how there are going to stack the deck against us for here on out in order to get special weapons then once I complete story and DLC stories that will be it for me and I'll just save myself the aggravation.",Not Recommended," February 10, 2019"

Ok, there are lots of positiv reviews. Honestlly, I dont know why. Maybe because I have never played the original game at earlier times? And I'm used to play modern games? Story might be great, but I honestly cannot concentrate on that because game mechanics are frustrating.

Shooting for example. If you shoot a zombie in the head, it seems nothing happened, so when you spend another three to five rounds on it, it will again get back up and you repeat the process again. And ammunition is a rare good...
This is just a non creative increase of difficulty, without any fun and destroys game flow for me.

Let me start by saying that I had not played these games before or done a lot of research, it had a lot of good reviews and was on sale. Graphics looked nice. I'm not unfamiliar with survival/zombie games so started the game on regular difficulty. Played for about 9hrs getting a handle on controls / combat and puzzle dynamics. Quickly apparent is pc weapons are very underpowered compared to general toughness of enemies. This was managable scraping by on ammunition and kneecaping regular enemies. The point where I shruged and said that the game really wasnt worth it was dealing with was when I was suddenly confronted by lickers and the boss type whom starts chasing you everywhere in combination. There seemed to be a lock-on principle where there was no hiding and loosing the boss type, in addition you couldnt fight him with the weapons you have.

TLDR - Zombies are too durable, and Mr X can teleport. Looks Great though.

The zombies just WON'T DIE. I had one come back to life 5 times taking 6-10 bullets to go down each time, even though I am on the hardest difficulty that is just too unfair. I've seen Mr. X go in so many directions when reloading the same save. You might be asking ""But isn't that a good thing."" or ""It just means he has a good A.I."". Yeah, I'd agree if it wasn't impossible for him to come from more that two of them without teleporting halfway across the map, or just to a different floor. You might be saying ""That;s just because he is scripted to be there, at that point or for that puzzle."" but no.

I got Re2Remake at half price.
It was worth $29.99. Like Onimusha, this game was quick.
I ****do not care**** for trying to be Mr. Speedrunner or ***NOT SAVE*** to improve my score.
Nor do I want to tirelessly spend my time trying to avoid every monster or zombie I can to zip through the game.

And, well, while RE2 was functionally nice, there was so much cussing and it was short.
I guess it was akin to a vulgar girlfriend who demeans you , but will give you the opportunity for a good time, which you may regret later.
While I got lots of achievements on my first run as Leon and Second run as Claire, I felt like I was done with the game.
I did not care to see what was going on with the Abusive & Vulgar Chief Irons, nor some runaway.
Hunk's mission is to run away from ***every*** monster there except for ones in your way and know exactly how to get out.
It is the same area. Even Kendo, going through the same places Leon and Claire went through with the only difference being enemy placement variation.

***GTFO*** . That's it. Run like a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Strategize how to run like a bat out of hell and die a bunch of times and do the ""training"" mode until you got it nailed down. Try not to die, because one bad move, and you are possibly back to the drawing board.

The game looked amazing. Played mostly well, except for having to deal with Alien Isolation : Zombies. Which is ok.... I guess.
I didn't feel like I cared enough to run around, waste my time, and shoot Raccoon Toys, but if I was ok, I did. Meh.

I honestly avoided and walked/ran away from Mr. X. Non-interference policy. Didn't even shoot him once. I actually had to go back, load up a save with him in it to shoot off his hat.

I did Claire and Leon in 10hrs. Playing it on a harder difficulty, being deprived even more, to do what I did, was an exercise in repetition. Getting 60% of the achievements and just not doing the ""Speedruns"", first time through, means game's done. If I feel like I want to pick it up, I will, but if I get VR, or something changes to the game, great. But Why would I care?

Doom Eternal nailed my $1 = 1hr upon release policy for games @ 68hrs.
This failed me as i'm at 25hrs.....

Some may enjoy wasting their time in a running simulator, not wanting to combat the enemies in this for a speedrun or just PLOW through it, but sometimes, it is really good to enjoy a game, take your time, soak up the textures and attention to detail a developer put into it.

I watched reviews on RE3 Remake and it's even shorter than this....No way I'm going to waste my CoronaBuck$ on something that will take me a day , maybe two to fill my fancy . >_>

I love Resident Evil, I played this game a million times. It's my favorite in the series. But would it have killed them to update the gameplay? Also, could there have been some consistency in the game's world? A truck driver is bitten and turns, Marvin the cop is bitten and turns, a kid was bitten and slowly turns in a horrific scene. But Leon just lets Zombies grab him like he's a little kid or something. He doesn't fight them off until AFTER he gets bitten. I thought wow, this game is going to be really hard as a zombie!! But no, I never turned. Would you have ever thought that herbs would cure the zombie apocalypse? The cure is all over the police station, all over the city too... but people are too dumb to use it. Only Claire and Leon are like, yeah we're surviving this because we're hot and cool! Leon wasn't going to give that annoying guy Marvin the cop and herb! I mean technically, Marvin didn't even save him... because if he was bitten in that scene, you'd just use an herb! Screw Marv!

Why couldn't they have come up with a grappling system that was fun to fight zombies with? How about dodging and foot work? Like a bat?? A bat instead of a knife?? A riot shield would have been awesome with like muay thai clinches and MMA style grappling, and like you could find kevlar forearm guards and gloves and knee pads and shin gear and you just clinch fight zombies with some slick controls... grab their heads and knee them to moosh!

Nah, just let them grab you and lose your lame knife in the process...

Overall though, the game is just nice nostalgia. I wish they had been a little more fun with the combat. I know RE was never meant to be like that, I just wish they'd have made it a little more realistic. You can't duck? Sneak? Pick up a bat? Nothing?? lol but the puzzles are nice and figuring out where to go is interesting for exploration. I love that part of it and the story is what makes me forgive the combat. The cutscenes are great and do not match the gameplay at all! They do amazing things in the cutscenes, then I just stare at my controls of choice like ... ... ... ... ... why can't I do that?? Hardcore mode just is not happening for me.

So I beat the first campaign (Leon) in 7 hours and a few minutes. Loaded up the 2nd campaign and realized within minutes it's the exact same thing, just look at other reviews on here. They have a couple new scenarios, but 80% is the same as the first play through. So if you think spending $60 for 7 hours of gameplay is worth it, by all means go ahead. To be clear the 7 hours of game play is really nice, the game is just far too short to justify the price point. $30 seems reasonable.",Not Recommended," January 29, 2019"

I played the first and (just to not write this game off too fast) the second playthrough, and both times the villain was just annoying and not scary at all (just my subjective opinion).

Resident Evil 2 is an average ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• simulator for teenage boys, who don't know what gender they are yet. It's not a game it's a pretty looking demo with ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•'s, did i mention this game has small to moderate ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s?

Resident Evil 5 had lots of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s, even Wesker had ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s, but what seperates this RE 2 from RE 5, it had an interesting story, i may go as far as saying it was story rich. I highly enjoyed RE 5, i have all the other Resident Evil titles and my eyes glaze over when playing them compared to RE 5.

Now this is the important stuff, i have 8.8 hours in RE 2's remake, in that time i beat the game. I could not find any reason to replay this game what so ever.

But i did find out why this game is Overwhelmingly HIV positive, it's because of the average size ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s, and nice jiggly asses and the nexus mods for people who want large popping ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. While i like a piece of cake and two apples like the next guy, i must give this game a thumbs down for a lack of a story, most good porno's have a story, i expect RE 3 Special Porno Edition to have a story.

I try to anser the question: Is RE2 good/worth 60 euros?

TL;DR: No, here are my main concerns:

At the lower end of the hardware spectrum, thats closer to the minimum specs recommended by Capcom (not below that) the re engine just produces stutters and seemingly random FPS drops that makes the game just not fun to play (at the moment at least). I do have Minimum specs and above, still stutters..

Unfortunate I have to give this fantastic game a poor recommendation. After waiting years to play, the game crashes to a screen that says it is a ""Fatal Application Exit"". I have looked into how to resolve this problem, and done all the necessary steps. However, all of my system requirements are up to date, my PC can more than handle this game: Windows 7, i74790k, 16gig RAM, 64 bit operating system, GTX 760, and Running Direct X 11. While I admit that my Graphics card may be a little old, it should run fine on a lower setting without crashing. And indeed, it did. The game stops working as Leon enters the scenario with the helicopter. The game freezes and crashes and a window pops up with the error. SO... While the game is actually fantastic, I will be asking for a refund unless someone knows how to fix the problem.

There is so much hype around this game. Countless reviewers praising this game.

BUT simply put, this is at most, 3 hour long game that extends its life by putting ever so slightly varied version of the exact same game play, story, and map.

We all know we only buy this game to get either nude mods on, and/or for getting the gatling gun and RPG.

All of the above can be accomplished well within 4 or so hours (TWO play through), so what does that leave us with?

Nothing. Exactly.

Don't get me wrong, the game play is fun, and really good graphics, with puzzling exploration. However, the fact that it is still charging about 50% of the retail price is atrocious.

VERDICT: Only get the game (the deluxe version) if it is at least 80% discount from RRP.

Update -- Feb. 6, 2019: To my surprise, Steam/Valve‚Äôs CEO Gabe Newell and David Underwood from the support team heard my voice and refunded my purchase of this game. I have never expected this. I am really grateful. Thank you Gabe and David.

Update -- Feb. 4, 2019: To add salt to my wound, Steam has rejected my refund request twice, thanks to me for being a loyal RE fan who first pre-ordered this game in August last year. Steam justified its rejection on my refund requests not made within 14 days of my pre-order purchase in August last year. What a joke. The game was released on January 25, 2019. Am I some kinda fortune teller who will know what will happen even before the game was released? To Steam, maybe yes, and hence the rejection to my refund requests. In short, I felt short-change. There goes my time and money. Mind you, the time spent on this game as stated under my profile here was the time wasted trying to launch it but failed while I am online. Sad.

Feb. 3, 2019: I am a big fan of RE. I played RE1 till RE7. But this RE2 Remake has failed me big time by simply not being able to launch/start. It just crashes even before I can see any cutscene or character from the game itself. I can only go as far as seeing the Capcom brand until RE Engine logo then everything ended with an error message. I don't think the issue lies with my Alienware as I can play RE7 to Agony without a single problem. I have tried many ways as suggested in Steam's community and by Googling but to no avail. I have wasted almost a day trying. I am fed up and I give up. I can't get back my precious time but I hope at least I can get back my money to buy other games (that I can at least launch or start) or just pay my grocery rather than have them wasted on this poorly made RE2 Remake game.

(SPOLER ALERT)

Was absolutely loving this game. Until I got to the first boss that is when i realised if you don't search through every where in this game it is nearly impossible to progress. I did manage to pass after about 10 tries because I had barely any ammo or anything going into the fight. I am not complaining about a challenge I love a good challenge in a game, however I am completely against a game that relies on you exploring every little nook and cranny just to be able to progress. In my opinion a good game should be 50/50 when it comes to that. Like if i want to spend another hour or 2 exploring everything getting myself some better loot or more ammo it should be my choice and as per any game you should get rewarded like a little bit easier boss fight or just more enjoyable because I have the big ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• 50 cal deagle. But if I want to just go through a game and just do the main campaign and only explore what I have to that should be fine and the game shouldn't punish me for doing so because not everyone wants to spend dozens of hours on just looking around and walking. Again i am not against exploring and finding things to make you a little stronger. But the length this game goes to relying on you getting everything is disgusting.

I am now pass the boss and have gotten through to where the dogs get out the cage right after you get the power on. Don't get me wrong love the dogs awesome fun and shooting them feels amazing. But i cannot gather enough ammo to kill them and make it back to the cell so my only option is to go back on a really far save or try and run away but i hate doing that in this game ruins the immersion in my opinion. I understand this is partially my fault for not searching everywhere but that shouldn't matter because a game should always give you the necessary resources to pass each section. I am not saying they have to hold your hand and give you everything just enough to make sure you can progress. So in order to progress forward I need to go right back to one of my earliest saves. I have been loving this game but that right there puts me off of it definitely not for me I extremely dislike game that make you go back on the same path multiple time just to unlock one small thing in my opinion it is just lazy and a cheap and easy way to get more content from a game.

Another thing that annoys me is like I said above this game is entirely based on going back over where you already searched but when you get in the area where you meet the first boss (underneath the statue after you unlock it). it just so happens the first time you cant go back on yourself is right before the boss fight where you need (in my case) better weapons or a crap load more ammo. Again to me that is just a lazy way to make things hard. They completely brake what the game has been the whole first sequence or whatever you want to call it. as that always give you the freedom to go back just in case you need a little more ammo or you forgot to get the shotgun or something similar I really want to right a positive review about the game because i was loving it . It has got so many good parts like the shooting, graphics, sound design, light design and so many others but to me what i have listed above is enough to turn a game from bloody amazing to just well not at all.

Hate it if you want but I hate bullet sponges. No dodging no ""shove"" mechanic makes it really hard to avoid zombies. This isn't really a horror but rather stress managment simulator.

DLC for 4.99.

If the zombies were a bit less spongy and knife didn't break then it would have been much more pleasant experience. As it stands now I really don't understand why people are so fond of this game lol.

It also misses the atmosphere a bit you are quickly thrown in from one situation / enemy to another. Kinda wished the game would ease you in a bit longer... my first playthrough took around 6 hours... and I still have to finish Claire's but I don't think I want to to be honest.

Just as I predicted replayability and the people playing this game dropped off to a dirt bottom rate looking at the steam review graph. Not as amazing as everyone said huh? Huge drop off after release date especially after a few weeks.

Meanwhile Skyrim maintains a heavy average across the board. Literally nobody is playing this game right now. Read below for my full review.

..................................................................................................

I am giving this a thumbs down due to the hype train everyone has helped create, but I still think you should eventually get it, especially if you are a real Biohazard fan.

I would wait for it to go on sale. It is a pretty good game but no where near as good as the Resident Evil 1 HD Remake.

I feel Resident Evil 7 was better in many ways 'I liked 7 for it's first person aspect and I think they should have at least implemented the first person perspective as an additional option 'not enough games have that these days, allowing players both the 3rd person and 1st person perspectives'.

It is good but there is something missing. I feel the environments could have been more complete and had better continuity. I also feel as though a lot of content has been chopped out of the final game.

""Warning!"" Screen space reflections are broken! And! ""Claire looks like a female mannequin with plastic surgery who farts a lot.""

I finished both the Leon and Claire campaigns. A lot of people are giving this game too high of accolades in my opinion. I feel the game review sites are over inflating how good it is. I personally like the game and have had a fun time playing it, but I disagree with the 95% that say, ""A return to form, it's absolutely AMAZZZING!"".

Shut up! No it's not. It's not absolutely amazing. Resident Evil 7 and the Resident Evil HD remake were amazing, this game is lacking.

RE 7 wipes the floor with this game, RE 7 is RE evolved into a proper and modern form but should have allowed classic 3rd person view as an option.

'''''Hopefully there are some performance updates for this game. My build is an i7 7700 65 watt and a GTX 1070 with 16GB of DDR4 2400 ram. I think it could have looked and performed better on this rig. Also DX12 performance is not that great.'''''

.................................................................................................................................................

""Claire looks like a female mannequin with plastic surgery who farts a lot.""

""Yea, that Leon he looks like a teenager who farts a lot too.""
.................................................................................................................................................

In the end it's a classic zombie shooter worthy of the Resident Evil title, the overall game play is a tad stale and still born, feels like a side grade and bit of a downgrade in the graphics department.

.................................................................................................................................................

((((As a side note I would like to point out that I think both Leon and Claire look like they sniff each others farts and I find that the most disturbing and scary aspect of the game.))))

.................................................................................................................................................

[7.6/10]

A quad core of the recent 5 years and a mid tier GPU such as a GTX 1060 should absolutely slaughter this game at max settings. Obsolescence through laziness tends to lend me the attitude of scathing rage.

I am absolutely certain that in the future, within a few years people will start to realize that this Resident Evil 2 remake is a bit of a gaseous backed up cheddar cheese log, wedged uncomfortably in the colons' of the modern gaming industry's consumer's, and that they will finally come to accept it for what it really is, which is a good game, but nothing exceptional.",Not Recommended," February 7, 2019"

Game about tedious running from one point to another. If you wanted to enjoy the atmosphere of the game, it is not here, or rather there are the first 10 minutes.

Personally, I cursed the developers a million times for something that is out of habit clicked the right button of the mouse on the objects that provoked the exit of the equipment( in any normal game, right click the mouse on the item displays the properties of objects and actions).

Pros - decent graphics I guess, DX12 is actually lower FPS than DX11 even on AMD card, cause that makes sense.
Cons - Going above 100% detail will quickly burn your GPU Frame Buffer, even with my 16GB Radeon VII, can only run 150% details because I'm out of GPU memory though I haven't tinkered with HBCC and frame rate is low enough there is no point. Also unfortunate not built on the much superior Vulkan API, cause who the F@#$ know why.
More Cons - character movement feels like pre-xbox, story lines are not intuitive and have nuanced time wasters like cracking codes or only turning on the light 3rd and 4th light switches or having certain items in your inventory you have to rotate to unlock something.

-No melee weapons other than a knife which will break after a few attacks, leaving you helpless and hopeless
-Cringy voice dialogue wrought with awkward smiles and facial gestures. This is a horror game meant to be scary. Using anything but the sort, makes the overall experience just short of lunacy; Poor game direction
-Enemies on fire, stay on fire. They do not drop to the floor or otherwise react, especially if they are in a hallway blocking your path. Poor level design which hindered the old version, returns. Very little improvements to the core design

It's a standard Resident Evil remake game. It would be fine, BUT the following ruins it:

If you die once on a Sherry (Claire's sidekick) mission, the game wants you to switch to ""assisted mode,"" i.e. easy mode. If you accidentally accept, you can't go back to normal difficulty. If you say no, it'll keep offering every time you die. Let's go over that again: if you die and press the wrong button, you can ruin your save file.

A single save file should be enough. I'm not playing RE2 for savescumming. This is unforgivable. Capcom is a multibillion dollar company. This game was play-tested thoroughly. It's not a bug, it's a ""feature."" I'd be happier if save files were more prone to just being corrupted.

It's basically a RE4 hybrid dressed up to be RE2, except I thought that RE4 was a bit more functional as far as gameplay goes. The gunplay seems super clunky and the zombies are bullet sponges which is a lazy development tactic when they don't want to spend time on actually making the game fun. If you get grabbed by one of them you may as well just sit back and wait for like 4-5 seconds while the scripted scene finishes because it doesn't seem like you can shove them off like every other RE game in existance.. I got bored in less than a hour. Not exactly a bad game, but not exactly in anyway worth $60 either, as I expected well before it's release..

Am lost for words, (given RE2's reception).

Firstly it is listed as survival horror. However surviving and horror take up about 20% of it, at absolute most. The rest is a ******* maze, and bellyache puzzles, none of which are mentioned in the description tags. Therefor, making RE2 a crawl. Giving credit to the game, all the puzzles are fathomable, once you think about them. There are just too many of them though; the puzzles are wall to wall. You finally claw your way through puzzles in one area, and walk slap into another puzzle-fest just the same.

It's one step forward and ten steps back through the entire game. That's because you explore and visit a place once. However you will backtrack there at least ten times; at least. (More like twenty times.) It's a technique that developers use to make it so they don't have to do much world building. Granted though the graphics are nice, so all the time it's nice to be wherever you are. That doesn't substitute however for an otherwise for me, empty rather boring experience.

When you actually encounter zombies, it's a good game. However that happens too rarely. There's probably only about thirty or forty in the whole rancid game. It's not a zombie shooter, or survival horror. It's a puzzle escape game, with a bit of shooting against hissing/snarling enemies.

I quit a few times, because i just could not be bothered. Messing up a shot could mean reloading a save because ammo was ridiculously scarce. When you've done that a few times you just think , ""**** **"", and quit. Or times when you're trying to sneak past but keep getting caught by unnaturally fast movement. If they could move that fast all the time, it would be game over from the start. To be honest though, I was pretty careful with my shots. I was always playing in dread though, because of the lack of ammo.

(I now know why the RE2 demo, was a once only 30 minute affair. It made me want to play on. After those thirty minutes though, in the retail version, that's when it goes like I said. In my opinion.)

it was good, but the zombies take way too many bullets, i would have been much happier with more zombies that took less bullets. the tyrant chasing you makes you rush through parts of that game that you should be taking in the scenery. its fun. but i beat it already and i doubt ill ever play it again unless theres some significant DLC that adds a co op or something worth playing more than once. honestly id rather play the original.
it was nice to revisit the old police station.
playing on standard mode was just stressful and wasnt enjoyable once the tyrant starts chasing you and have to deal with no ammo and the zombies while avoiding the tyrant and claires story just feels like theres more to it or like it was meant for her.

My favorite thing about RE games has always been the unlockables, but this game makes it so asininely difficult. Beating the game on hardcore in under 2 1/2 hours is challenging enough, but with only 3 saves? Having to do over an entire half hour just to die to a 1 hit kill from Mr. Takes-it-up-the-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is a lesson in restraint. Anyone who can get an S+ rank doesn't need unlimited ammo so why make it so difficult?

I love the game - played the original back then. The worst thing that happenend is that the game froze at some point and since restart my windows won't boot properly . so thanks for that - not :) The game is visually very nice but unfortunately Resident evil 7 was created already and I feel that this is a stand back even though it is a different experience. The story is nothing that you can be commited to and it ruins the overall experience. Also why do you have to shoot a zombie six times in the head with a pistol - it is way more powerful. I would have provided less ammo and more power to the pistol. It's a good game if you like to 're-experience' and of course if you are young enough to have this to your first experience, but who loved resident evil 7 I think will have a slight disappointment. Being said that I will still try to play it trhough after fixed my pc hoping it will be still a good experience.

Despite it's beautiful appearance, I decided to refund the game after less than an hour.
Resident Evil 2 back on PlayStation was my first experience with the series and I've been devotedly playing RE ever since. Having said that, I found this remake to be a disappointment, like so many RE titles. The last good one in my opinion, being 4.

I played Claire and in my short playtime I found her extremely unrealistic. She is unbelievable composed for such a young woman suddenly finding herself among hordes of the undead. With no information at all, she doesn't hesitate to run past wounded men and start blasting zombies in the head with her pea shooter. Even upon finding and losing Leon in a fiery explosion, she shows next to no emotion, just goes on like, 'Meh, I've done this before.' She even touches brutally torn corpses with bare hands, again, having no idea what causes the obvious problems plaguing the city, and doesn't even seek to wash up after. Even during battle, our, likely sociopath, heroine stoically faces down zombies with one liners that sound far more frustrated than scared. She doesn't even question when she hears her beloved brother, whom she came quite a ways to check on, in the rain, on a bike, fighting zombies, is on vacation. Their relationship sounds especially solid when she hears Chris went on 'vacation' without a word to his little sister and she simply accepts it as fact. It's tempting to think Claire is some sort of bigger than life hero archetype, but the way she casually says to a wounded man, a colleague of her dear brother, that she only plans to find Chris and leave, giving zero interest to other survivors, including the one right next to her, it seems far more likely that this chick is just insane or very poorly scripted.

The combat is also something I found to be disappointing. Again, having played less than an hour, not skipping any cut scenes, all I've faced were zombies. And again, props on the character models and variation, beautiful work, but shooting them always felt like a complete waste of ammo. I line up shot after shot, nailing zombies in the face time after time, and it's practically ignored. After several shots they fall down... and then get up. I definitely understand the frustrated comments spit by Claire. WTF? This game doesn't reward marksmanship? Fine, classic RE tactic, slash downed zombies with knife. But the knife has durability. THE KNIFE HAS DURABILITY. Throughout the series the knife has been your trusted last line of defense, and occasionally, incredibly lethal weapon, Code Veronica. This RE 2 Remake knife breaks after a few hits. Marvin passed this internet bought display piece off like it was the key to your salvation and it breaks after a few hits.

I didn't get to meet Mr. X but from what others are saying, he sounds like another major annoyance. I personally believe that any game that relies on invincible, or otherwise undefeatable, enemies to make a game challenging is just lazy programming. Rather than working to make an AI that is difficult to overcome but rewards the clever or skilled player, just make it invincible. Nice.

I bought this game when it was on sale for 40 USD. After my hour, I do not believe it will be worth the cost. Like so many 'AAA' titles these days, this smells like a turd wrapped in a shiny wrapper. I'll happily, and without much interest, wait for the fan boy crazy to dissipate and Capcom to get desperate enough to put it on sale for 20 or less before even thinking of bothering again.",Not Recommended," April 27, 2019"

Exactly what I asked for, but turns out it wasn't what I actually wanted, and a perfect example of Steam needing a 'It depends' option for recommendations.

Technically, this game is a really great piece of work, especially the graphics settings. My only technical issue has been some sound cutout issues when moving between rooms. Storywise, they tightened up the story and it flows better. The new voices aren't as good, but are perfectly fine taken on their own. Gameplay wise, the game controls as well as it should, and the third person camera angle is a trade off from the original, but the gameplay improvement combined with the fact it makes you worried about what might be sneaking up on you greatly outweighs the cinematic elements the static images allowed the original game. If you never played the original, this is a must play.

If you played the original, especially with the goal of speed running it, thats where things get hairy. The gameplay, once you've seen the story, is all about speed running and efficiency. It's about pathing to increase how fast you can pick up necessary items and knowing where to spend your resources. Zombie games today are more about resource management and exploration, and while this game gets the resource management part right in the sense that it creates tension and fear, I feel like the lack of exploration, bordering on penalization of exploration by costing you health and bullets with respawning zombies, (in standard at least) renders that great stage design kind of moot. And thats just not what I want to be playing these days. I'll try dropping the difficulty down and seeing if that makes a difference with this feeling.

TL;DR: It's a great game, especially if you didn't play the original version or still love the original's gameplay, but the old school game's gameplay design of 'do fetch quests in the most efficient line and conserve resources' doesn't feel as good to me anymore, so I just cannot recommend it.",Not Recommended," January 30, 2019"

I would love to recommend this game. It's defintely fun, and will give you hours of entertainment. However I feel I cannot recommend it due to the terrible frame stutter and slowdown that has dogged my footsteps harder than Mr X. At first it was hardly noticeable, a slight pause in Leon's movements as I ran from room to room. Upon opening my first item box the slowdown became hugely apparent, almost 10 minutes lost attempting to navigate it due to the continous freezes for several seconds (at a minimum) at a time. Then it just got worse and worse, to the point cutscenes were affected, leading to moments where characters were speaking lines that hadn't come up on screen yet, several screens in advance, and then nothing but deathly silence for the rest of the cutscene, to the point it might as well have been muted. Due to the fact this appears to be affecting others as well, and various 'help' articles online have not been successful, I feel an update for the game is sorely required.

You couldn't ask for a better remake of game. That said, you also couldn't possibly ask people to pay a full AAA price tag, on a game with as much content as one from 1998....

Resident Evil 2 is remade beautifully into the current gen. But do not go thinking this is as far as a reboot, for it's closer to just simply a remaster. The classic from 1998 has simply been brought into the current gen and that is it. Few minor changes to accommodate this and that's all. Leon's full playthrough takes around 8 hours to complete, and here's the catch, Claire's campaign is the exact same, re-used campaign, with only a few minor changes here and there, like different weapons or enemy/boss spawns, and of course a different perspective on what is still the same story with just a different, accompanying side character. So you're paying ‚Ç¨60 for 8 hours of content, and then only another 8 hours of the exact same content, just with a few twists....

It's a shame what is still a brilliant remake, is being cheeky enough to ask for what other games provide up to 60 hours worth of content and more.. Now, Resident Evil 2, besides the one campaign served twice depending on what you prefer to have between your legs, does have some side content. Such as three sort of mini side-quests where you play as characters from the background of the main story, trying to escape whatever situation they're in, in an almost speedrun style of gameplay. There's like 20 minutes of gameplay there... And then there's the classic 'new game +' option which slightly changes the start and end of the campaigns but nothing more....

All in all, this game is not nearly worth the asking price. It's brilliantly done, and really rings true to the classic survival-horror/puzzle genre. This game actually succeeds where Resident Evil 7 miserably failed. It's genuinely scary at times and has a decent mix of that Resident Evil action and overall vibe. But still, for what amounts to less than 10 hours of true content, and replayable content that amounts to nothing more than a grinding feel as you attempt to unlock everything... You can't possibly pay full price for this remake.

Before you read this review, and god forbid, buy this flaming dumpster zombie, go play Resident Evil 4, Dead Rising 2, Alien Isolation, Amnesia the Dark Descent and Dead Space. Have you played those yet? Good, then you have no reason to play this recycled sack of zombie trash! Resident Hellno 2 is a game where you play as a repo-man (or woman) with the world‚Äôs smallest backpack. Dealing with a 100% customer dissatisfaction rating, where your cannibal clientele‚Äôs only rebuttal is to chew your face off!
Here is 10 point rating systems for these games along with what quality embodies them best.

Resident Evil 4-9/10 (combat)
Amnesiac the Dark Descent- 9/10 (sound design)
Dead Space- 8.5/10 (level design)
Alien Isolation- 8.5/10 (survival)
Dead Rising 2- 8/10 (exploration sandbox)
Resident Evil 2- 2/10 (tedium)

So, why does Resident Evil 2 gets a 2/10? Because every other game I mentioned does an aspect of it better while respecting your time. But the real sin is how RE2 makes exploration and combat into boring, repetitive chores! You will never feel like a kill is satisfying, never feel accomplished when waste 90% of your ammo on a boss and never feel like your endless mcguffins get you any closer to escaping the infection.

Backtracking
Over half your time in game is a scavenger quest where you find items and then carry them around like a survivalist kleptomaniac. It gets really old when you have to guess at the adventure-game logic behind each item. You are forced to use a walkthrough or waste about 2 hours guessing and cursing as you waste ammo and healing items. However, using walkthroughs is tedious as RE2 will lock your screen onto their game. That‚Äôs right, no matter what display setting you use, alt-tabbing is impossible without using Ctr-Alt-Del task manager! Yes RE4 does this, but game is 14 years old, where this was made ‚Äúremastered‚Äù from scratch.

Unlike all other games in the past 20 years, ammo doesn‚Äôt stack instantly, maybe because the Devs love the ‚Äúauthentic experience‚Äù or some BS. Your guns take up 1 slot in your inventory, and oh do you want to upgrade them? Now they take up 2 slots! This comes to a head when you have to juggle multiple kinds of ammo and have 3+ ‚Äúkey items‚Äù that cannot be dropped. Leon, you have a freaking police vest full of pockets, and yet a nine volt battery takes as much space as your handgun? In future (better) games all give you a separate inventory for story items, but in RE2 it stinks of lazy coding.

To make the enemies more threatening they sped them up and increased their resistance to bullets. Lickers attack you instantly and stunlock you with impossible to dodge ranged attacks. Zombies lunge faster than an Olympic fencer and have a reach that stretches like Mr Fantastic. Then there‚Äôs the ‚Äúzombie‚Äù dogs, these unholy mixes of dobermans, and zambonis! They never stop moving, and they skate around like they are hovering about 2 inches off the floor. Worse yet, their choppy huge leaping animations are headache inducing. The cherry on top is that you can‚Äôt shoot them if they get too close. In one chapter I have been hit by them over 10 times even after I reloaded an autosave and knew EXACTLY where they are. I have even been hit multiple times AFTER I KILL THEM. Apparently, they need time to determine that they are dead even when shot in the head.

Then there‚Äôs the aspect of being ‚Äúhunted‚Äù. As Leon you are hunted by Mr. X. a giant, mute, invincible, stompy man looks like Watchman‚Äôs Rorschach on steroids. You can‚Äôt interact with him and he ‚Äúimproves‚Äù the game like a traffic accident improves a morning commute. He will force you to camp in the safe rooms and either deviate from the most efficient routes or waste your ammo to killing enemies.

My final straw was when the game pulled a Licker (giant skinned red thing) out of it‚Äôs ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• while running from Mr X. Literally, with no background cues, no warning and zero chance to defend myself I open a door and a licker pops into a room and takes out half my health. I get up and put over 30 bullets into the licker and it still doesn‚Äôt die, but it kills me when I run out of ammo. Why not run? Because their tongues are just as fast and make you stumble so they kill you while you try to limp away.

What weapons? 1 shotgun, 1 handgun, 1 magnum, a laughable bad flamethrower, and some flimsy, breakable knives. The real issue is the impact of your bullets. Even when you shoot zombies in the head they STILL don‚Äôt even flinch much, and even your shotgun sometimes doesn‚Äôt kill them unless at point blank range. But why not use a knife? Well the knives are degrade like compostable tin-foil and their main use it so stick them in an enemy they will let you go. And you only get them back when you down the enemy they are stuck in.

Dear god, these devs love noisy sound design. Half the jumpscares in the game are from zombies that sound like someone took a blender to their vocal cords. Don‚Äôt wear headphones unless you enjoy torturing your eardrums. Worse yet, you can‚Äôt tell the lickers from the zombies and even Leon‚Äôs SHOES sound like he‚Äôs wearing steel toe boots wrapped in lead fishing weights!

Here‚Äôs the real proof that this game sucks. The achievements. Right now there is only a 51% completion for Leon‚Äôs Campaign, and less than 40% of Clair‚Äôs story and 12.4% for the final survivor. That means that people got so tired of the game that they didn‚Äôt even finish the 1, let alone, both parts of the main parts of the story. I suffered through Leon‚Äôs because I love him and Ada Wong in RE 4 but I know Claire‚Äôs missions have escort quests. Escort quests with limited ammo, no melee ability, no way to resupply AND glitchy headache-inducing enemies? No thank you!

Capcom, if this is a survival horror, don‚Äôt make your enemies into bullet sponges, it‚Äôs more frustrating than horrifying. If you want another (good) zombie game MAKE ANOTHER (good) DEAD RISING! That was the only survival game with weapon degradation that was a feature and not an annoyance. This stupid ‚Äúmy weapons are useless‚Äù BS make me wonder if this is game was just one long advertisement for real weapons.

Basically, it is a massive disappointment. As a fan of Resident Evil 2, I cannot stand some of the choices the developers have decided to go for.

Things like zombie heads taking much more ammo to pop, ammo being more scarce than in the original (or at least it sure feels like it), knife, which is in the game only to save ammo and is generally a bad weapon, for some reason is breakable, making it both even more useless and makes you waste even more ammo. Also, you are constantly hunted by a character that cannot be killed while in the original, not only could you kill him, but he would leave behind goodies for you to loot.

First off, I have to say this is basically a very good game indeed, with great graphics and a good story.

It's just not a game for me, that's all - I'm not a fan of horror games, plus I REALLY, REALLY don't like cut-scenes, there's WAY too much back-tracking, too little ammo, too little carry space for ammo or gear, I find Mr X totally annoying and irrelevant to the story, and it sucks big time not being able to escape a zombie if he's got hold of you until the 3-second chomp-on-the-neck scene has played through, needing several shots to the head to put just one z down...and then he gets up again, the knife ""weapon"" being about as useful as a plastic teaspoon... I could go on...

Then there's the ridiculous alligator-in-the-sewer section, complete with its' own cut-scene, which I had to repeat 20 times until I managed to escape it. Pathetic!!! - you call that gaming? - I call it cr***ing on the user. Gimme some weapons that pack a punch, with enough ammo to mow down hordes of Z's!

Honestly this is the worst excuse for a game I`ve played for a long time. The biggest load of fake prescripted nonsense and awful controls I`ve seen since.. probably any of the other Resident Evil`s. I honestly don`t get it but back in the day it was passable because it was the only game in town, but even then Silent Hill came along and showed you didn`t need this awful rubbish as an excuse for difficulty. Games have evolved so much since then yet this hasn`t changed even a a little bit from what made the originals an absolute chore to play, except now you can save as much as you like so progress ?
What`s the appeal about having a character that steers like a battleship, wobbling all over the place, constantly getting stuck on door frames and every other piece of tinyscenery because the controls are so hopelessly terrible ? Enemies that have been placed to only ever spawn at exact moments because..lazy and also enemies that just drop straight on top of you because Fark actual gameplay, we`re just too lazy to care about placing enemies now we`ll just drop them out of the air ? Enemies that lurch wildly left and right deliberately to waste your bullets because otherwise they`d be no challenge at all. Every enemy is also set in a tight corridor so there`s no way to go around and is a also a trigger event to wake up the second you walk away because `oooh scary`. No, I`m very sorry but No, Not scary, Not at all, Absolutely Tedious. A complete waste of the graphic talent afforded on a remake and trading on it`s name only, because the `game` part of this is complete waste of time as you try to redo the same tired rubbish over and over in the vain hope that some enemy won`t just materialise out of nowhere or lurch 20 feet across the room and kill you because reasons. The only scary thing this game has to offer is how much of you r life you wated to play it and now you`re just that little bit closer to death with nothing of any consequence to show for it other than having watsed yours (and my) life on it.
If you liked the originals and I have no idea why you did, you`ll probably like this but if you never experienced the originals then leave it in the past which is where this awful mess should be buried and forgotten among your pets backyard contributions.

This started out looking like it was going to be a great game but the ammo rationing got really stupid, really fast and essentially ruined the game for me to the point I doubt I'll finish it! Zombies take about 10 rounds to kill on medium difficulty but you'll probably never have more than 20 rounds in your inventory at any one time. And you can just forget about taking on anything bigger than a zombie with a handgun, you'll just die over and over. I know this game isn't an action/shooter but spending most of your time running away from everything because you're always nearly out of ammo isn't scary, challenging or fun; it's just irritating and frustrating.... at least to me. And don't get me started on Mr. X. Whoever thought having an unkillable, unstoppable monster that chases you around the entire game guaranteeing you can't take any time figuring things out should be horsewhipeed.

On the positive, the graphics look great and I really enjoyed Claire's character. She's hot to look at and well played by her voice actor. The atmosphere is also superb and since I played the original 25 years or so ago, all the throwback designs and references were really nice.

Overall this is a really well made game with great graphics, voice acting and gameplay. Unfortunately the ammo rationing just sucked all the fun out of it for me.

If your tastes lean more towards Dead Space then avoid this one or at least wait and catch it on sale so you don't waste $60.",Not Recommended," February 1, 2019"

TL;DR: This is not a faithful remake of the classic Resident Evil 2, it is a hard reboot.


RE2 is one of my favorite games of all time and in my top 10 games of the PS1 era. I played though both scenarios all 4 ways possible, then went for the goal of unlocking all the weapons, costumes and scenarios. Learning when to shot and when to move become an almost meditative experience as you learned which enemies you needed to dodge and which to confront. There was a sort of satisfaction learning when was the best time to use each weapon, I remember the first time I learned the right time to best use the bolt gun for instance, it was a game changer. On top of that each boss presented a unique the pattern to learn and there was something special about figuring out how to take them down with the least amount of ammo and health lost. If that wasn't enough there was the rich lore and extra items hidden in the background littering every new area, adding depth and breadth to every corner of not just the game but the RE universe. Lets not forget a highly memorable score with tunes that would time and again find themselves in later RE games in one form or another.

The vast majority of that did not make it into RE2:‚ÄùRemake.‚Äù Although the graphics recreate some areas of RE2 with stunning accuracy, such as the first rooms of the Police station, the rest of feels very ‚Äúforeign,‚Äù I'll explain what I mean by that in a few lines. The score is gone replaced by ambient bumps and groans, which are atmospheric, but not RE2. The use of weapons has been gimped to the point of them almost being useless, the scaling difficulty making it pointless to engage in any combat, which in turn makes combat for a vet RE2 player like me a boring chore. I thought at first ‚ÄúI must be stupid, I must be doing something wrong, but no, I checked online and many other were having the same experience as me, many also frustrated with the way the game is designed to punish the player for doing anything more then running. The surprising part was how many people seemed to be loving the game, a concept I must say is completely lost on me. Even running proves impossible when the Zombies seem to be able to latch onto you from an obscene distance, sometimes in pairs or more.

I am crest fallen over this, years ago there was a remake of the Classic RE, the original and it was truly something. The people who worked on RE1 remake took what I might liken to someone humming a tune and turned it into a full fledged song with lyrics. RE1 remake was completely faithful to the original in game-play style while building on it to add new mechanics and challenges for old players returning...like coming home and finding some angry red mean people moved in, but I loved every min of it. Not to mention the beautiful interface and remixes of old music. This was my expectation going into RE2 remake and I went on media blackout to avoid spoilers, so I ended up blindsided by RE2 remake.

Most confusing about all the love this game is getting is how people are ok with how much has been pealed off and made into DLC. The memorable soundtrack I mentioned earlier? DLC, not even a remix of the original or an orchestrated version, the original soundtrack for the game is behind an additional pay wall: Come. The ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. ON. If this were a Dragon Age remake people would flay EA alive for something like that.

After a few hours and a restart, I just gave up. Like I said above the game feels ‚Äúforgien‚Äù by that I mean it feels less like an RE game and more like Outlast, Amnesia or Slenderman, only could you imagine one of those games with no hiding spots? Harder difficulty doesn't always make for better play as the makers of SOMA found out when people said they enjoyed the game more without the insta-kill monsters, they even released a patch later that allowed players to simply play the game without constantly being harassed and it was a good choice, IMO.

That was all Capcom had to do here, was offer a choice of ‚Äúclassic‚Äù or ‚Äúremake/reboot‚Äù mode.

Now I hear they are considering remaking my favorite of the old RE's, that being Nemesis and if it turns out like this...well not only will it miss the point of the game it will be a crying shame for old fans like me.

Obviously I don't recommend it unless such a mode is patched in but I don't see it happening since the majority seem to be enamored with the game. I'm also not turning comments on for this review because much like BOTW and FO4 we wont be able to have a civil or constructive discourse about this game till the hype dies down in about 6 months to a year.

Last Resident Evil game I tried was RE6 and I hated it. Tried this because it has such glowing reviews. This isn't nearly as bad as 6 but I can stand games that artificially inflate the difficulty with poor game mechanics.

Your character whether walking or running moves incredibly slowly. You can't jump over or even step over any obstacles. Zombies take about a half dozen head shots to kill and ammo is extremely rare. There is no option to melee zombies. If one grabs you then you just have to wait for it to finish chewing on you.

You play as an absolute nobody and go around and do nothing except matching shapes to holes. There is nothing I can recommend about this game. The characters are all insufferable and idiotic (you have the nobody main character who pretends to be so charismatic but is actually a 1 dimensional 0 trait personality, and the other characters contribute no substance but being there to die or to make painful to watch conversation with the main character), the setting is boring and makes no sense (unicorn statues and secret hallways in a police station?), the story is a snorefest (theres a girl, you seek the girl, the end. The plot goes nowhere, does nothing, and IS nothing), the combat is atrocious and clunky, the enemies takes 40 bullets each, so at this point the zombies are not enemies but rather environmental hazards to be stepped around, the game content and gameplay actually put the person I was playing with to sleep. You walk around, match the square key to the square hole, walk around some more, repeat ad nauseum. Walking simulators are fine. Some of my all time favorite games are walking simulators, but they keep it engaging with an interesting atmosphere, characters you can relate to and care about their struggles, engaging puzzles and environments. This game has none of that.

In summation, none of the environments, characters or interactions, story, or gameplay is engaging or creative. It doesnt make you think, it doesnt make you feel, so what is the point?",Not Recommended, March 24

A substantial re-make of RE2 but plagued by excruciating brightness issues.

In terms of the game itself I can really appreciate the quality of life improvements:
-Mostly helpful checkpoints
-Improved combat interface (closer to RE4)
-No ink ribbons needed
-Ada is even cooler

I would have loved if they had taken the time to re-make the stories, giving Claire and Leon completely seperate missions that overlapped at various points with only minor shared areas of exploration. Perhaps Leon could be out in the city looking for survivors, or a hair-dresser while Claire searches the station for clues to Chris' whereabouts. Playing as the other character would fill in the blanks of what happened to them while you were on the other mission. It was kind of excusable in 1998 as it had to fit on CD-ROM, plus we were all a lot younger and didn't know better! Now I'm struggling to see the point of re-playing the game just to see the 5 different rooms that contain re-used puzzles. It doesn't even make any narrative sense, if Claire and Leon's stories were supposed to be happening concurrently, why weren't they seeing each other all the time in the police station? How did either of them end up on the outside of the fence near the fire escape? This is a missed opportunity on Capcom's part and they cheaped out.

But what's really wrong and what actually makes this game unplayable is the brightness. Yes, I said brightness. Holy hell! The mercurial, inexplicable brightness problems in this game! I never thought that would be a problem we'd encounter in 2019 and its behaviour is so random that it must be a bug. Given that there's very little talk about this in people's reviews of the game it probably is a bug.
Let me list the bizarre issues with the game's brightness:
-When the character uses the flashlight the entire screen is washed out
-Different rooms randomly cycle between dark and light
-The same room will display at different levels of brightness each time you enter, depending on which direction you're facing, what your blood iron composition is, whether the moon is in the 7th house
-Brightness levels can drop to near 0 visibility with only a few highlights or light sources visible
-The extreme darkness issue will persist even if brightness is turned all the way up

In fact when I first booted the game the darkness was so pervasive that I couldn't see what was going on in the opening cut scenes and could only barely make out what was happening at the gas station. This was KIND OF fixed by setting it to Direct X 11 but it was still significantly busted and buggy, resulting in the issues I listed above. Ultimately I stopped playing halfway through Claire's story because one room got so dark that I couldn't see the elements of a puzzle.

Overall, this is a mostly enjoyable game that went out of its way to stop me enjoying it. I think the graphics are good, when you can see them. If you're unlucky enough to have the brightness problems you'd be better off getting it on console. On sale.",Not Recommended," January 28, 2019"

2 out of 5 stars.

This game has good qualities, then completely fk ing ruins it for me with the bads.

Edit: After playing another 6 hours and beating the bosses, my conclusion: This game is a complete waste of time. There is just one way to beat the bosses: go here, press this, then go there, press that. Repeat. THE ENTIRE GAME HAS THIS PATTERN with every single episode. Completely repetitive and boring. There is no freedom to play any other way except do exactly how the designer intend, step-by-step. If you enjoy the freedom of modern open-world type of games, this will feel like a closed-world. I got this on sale for $20 and wish I had spent it on another game.

First, the game would not start at launch. Do a quick search and you'll find a bunch of people with this issue since Jan 2019. For me, it was fixed by editing and disabling ""UseVendorExtention=Enable""
But the fact that this is still happening to people is ridiculous. When people pay for a game, IT SHOULD AT LEAST START. NEVER MIND PLAY SMOOTHLY, JUST START.

About the game. It has nice graphics, atmosphere, and mystery, and it is a modern version of the old game. But when compared to modern survival games, this game is annoying AF. First, you find so few bullets IN A POLICE STATION and zombies take FOREVER to kill. Then you get a knife, WHICH BREAKS. That's okay, you can still kick, punch, jump. No wait, YOU CAN'T.
I get the fact they are trying to make it more scary by making players helpless. I don't find it scary, I find it frustrating and annoying, when all you can do is run. It should be named: Resident Evil: Forest Gump...run forest run.
And when enemies grab you, there is no defense mechanism -- no punching/kicking/pushing back, unless you have a knife -- once they get close and the biting animation starts, just sit back, drink some water, stare at the screen, and wait for the animation to be over, then run again. This makes the game play feel so disconnected/predetermined. This is how old games were designed, I guess we are still stuck in the past.

The other thing that COMPLETELY RUINS THE GAME for me was that re t a r d e d giant guy that never dies. Just follows you around and annoys while you're trying to solve a puzzle. OKAYYYYY? Is this supposed to be scary? Imagine trying to solve a puzzle, and there is a person next to you poking, making noise, shaking the table your puzzle is on. That's what the giant guy feels like.

For me, a good game has nice visuals, environment, good game controls, and freedom to do things, instead of being preset to go to A, then B, then C. That was how old games were made and I find it completely boring. Once the game is passed, there's no reason to play. I know you can repeat the same game over and over to unlock guns, and I guess this was a thing back then in the 90's, but who the hll does that now? That is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• boring.
In modern open world games, there are continuous amounts of thing to do on your own and unlock during the game and enjoy it, and this game doesn't have a lot of that.
Coupled with crippled character design for helplessness and that annoying AF giant guy (especially), I don't find it worth it to spend money on instead of other current games and would not buy this similar types of game.",Not Recommended," December 25, 2019"

Really, 20 bullets to the head doesnt kill a zombie? This is not resident evil. This is resident dumbass shooting pees like those plants in PvZ. Good concept, good effort, but in the end - just an unrealistic, artificial difficulty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• of a game. What is the point of being able to aim if it is down to luck anyway? Sometimes a head shot from the weakest gun 1 shots and sometimes 30 bullets do not do it.

I am a fan of the movies. And in the movies 1 head shot does it. Not 30. Not 20. Not 10. Just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•en 1. I would much rather you make the ammo more scarce and force the player to actually aim then simply make it down to luck or some other bs. For example - I replayed the G1 boss 8 times trying to see how efficiently I can do it... Every single time I defeated the boss with either my last bullet or my second to last grenade. I am sure as hell in a few of the runs I did not miss a shot while in a few others I missed almost every other shot and somehow, ridiculously enough, I always kill the boss with my very last bullet............

Would prefer to like the game and actually play the bonus modes and complete the B runs but all it does is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me off. Can not recommend to anyone who plays their games with skill.

Conclusion - not the game for the skilled player. It is the game for the re-player who likes to do the singe mission 20-50 times until they memorize the entire map and the enemies on it. In this game there is no rewards for being good, being creative, or being able to aim. In the end all that matters is knowing where every enemy is and how to get around them because with 10-20 headshots per weakest enemy there is not enough ammo or even reason to try and fight. Also im pretty sure even accuracy is down to luck - a few times i had the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ers head in the middle of the crosshairs and somehow still missed. Just remember where they are, how to run around them, and you get the S+ run through. Be good and all you get is being mulch for stupidly tank like enemies.",Not Recommended, January 26

TL;DR: Buy this on sale when you can justify the price for a single, 8 hour campaign.

So... my first run through was fun, a bit annoying I couldn't actually kill enemies for the most part, but hey, some nice tense RE goodness.

Then I went to go again with Claire and I realised just how messed up everything was...

For starters, before I even got to the police station I saw how I was retreading my same steps as Leon when I expected what was written on the tin in the title menu: ""Play Claire's Story"", not ""Play The Story As Claire"".

Previous games in the franchise and the presentation gave me expectations that the game crushed. I haven't finished Claire's ""story"", from what I understand the only difference is about 25% of the game at the end.

You have a mode for a 2nd play through which supposedly changes some events through the story but... *shrug* once bitten, twice shy as the saying goes.

The next big issue I noticed after I got to the station was that the understanding of how the game works was ruining the fun.

In a traditional RE game you carefully progress and enjoy crafted encounters with enemies as you battle the camera, then you have modern RE games that are third-person, and that's taken away some of the tension as its easier to aim, and I don't feel this has taken away from 'what was' so to speak, but thickened the layer of action that was always there.

That said, in this you're discouraged from fighting zombies. Full stop, no buts, there is literally no reason to fight something unless its in your way or you know it will be soon, because all your basic zombies are bullet sponges.

Allow me to put enemy balance into perspective:


I have shot our humble zombies once and they have died permanently and I've shot them 5 times (which is about the max head shots I ever seem to need) only for them to go down and instantly get back up, then go back into a temporary down state until I leave the area and return before it finally dies permanently, as indicated by its head completely exploding, because you see kids, the regular ""death"" for a zombie is... TEMPORARY! WOOT!

For a bit more detail, shooting zombies in a particular section of the head means nothing, I've hit the same point and had wildly different results, giving them practically random health pools, but you cant afford to be wasting ammo on them or you're going to be stuffed when the next G virus fight comes along.

So hows this actually ruin the game you ask. I found myself just trying to avoid fights because I knew it would be better to have enough ammo later to be able to let loose a little and not have to worry too much about the enemy bosses (and everyone else's) very heavy animations that swing them around, making it difficult to hit, and that takes out a huge portion of the game that, as I explained, was always core to the experience.

I thought ""Claire's Story"" would be completely different, meaning I wouldn't know where enemies are and where to go or what I'm doing, but that not being the case, you cant help but avoid what you know is just 'in your way', rather than a challenge to dominate.

The last big issue is co op: There is no reason for this... if ""Leon's Story"" and ""Claire's Story"" were just that then I would understand that the additional work of adding in a co-op experience for both of the stories might have been no better than playing as a nameless, voiceless, faceless mook like Ada's story in RE6, but that's not what happened, we didn't get a mook partner for a story that was crafted to be SP, we got a co op story that was split apart into two SP stories with not even a mook tag along.

There is NO reason RE2 couldn't have been a co op story like RE5 with that last 25% or so brought together into a single cohesive plot, and short of something sensible like that there's no reason not to make the story a basic co op experience, satisfying many fans expectations, as we saw worked fine in Ada's RE6 story which was otherwise crafted to be SP.

That all said, the first run through was fun for the 8 hours it lasted and if the game didn't pretend there was more value to be had than that initial 8 hours I would praise it but this isn't a traditional RE game, its a sub par modern RE game that cant justify its price tag.

RE2 doesn't bring RE back to its roots, and it detracts from what makes modern RE games enjoyable. RE2 is a casualty of trying to recapture nostalgia.",Not Recommended," February 11, 2019"

Mr X - Great improvement on this antagonist. Really ramps up the tension and pace.



Cons:

You are kinda forced to use a controller (you CAN use keyboard and mouse but good luck)

Bits of stories are cut out making certain parts of the game vague and nonsensical (helicopter crash for example)

A few bugs here and there and frame rate drops but overall not a bad release.

NO explosive grenade rounds?!?! Really Capcom?

The game is half finished.

There isn‚Äôt a 'second run'. CAPCOM lies about this.

Did I mention there isn‚Äôt a ‚Äòsecond run‚Äô?



CAPCOM, this isn‚Äôt a remake but an extended DEMO and here's why:

You beat the game‚Äôs main story with (insert character) so now you normally get to enjoy the side story of the other character while you were running about willy nilly. This doesn‚Äôt happen! Rewind back to the 'splosion in the city: Instead of you taking control at the separation and making your way to the station through the ALTERNATE ROUTE, the game tells you, ""Nah dude... you don‚Äôt want to play the alternate story...here let me just fade the cutscene out aaaaaand in we go! Police department rear entrance! There ya go!"" Not only that, the (B) walkthrough is exactly the same story as if you played that character as your main... minus you get a secondary gun which is just cosmetic. There isn't any increased damage given between the 9 mm and the 45 (for leon) not to mention the stupid way he holds the gun. You face the same boss sequences and encounters just like if you were playing their main campaign. CAPCOM listen... if you played Claire and you see Mr X ripped in Twain by William, killing him... You can‚Äôt just ‚Äòrevive‚Äô Mr X without so much as a scuff on his trench and pit him against LEON as an END BOSS... just no... wth? The only other difference is that only a few items are scattered to different locations and the LT is already dead. A whopping 50% of the original game is cut. You do not enter different areas like the original, you do not have your own antagonist either, nor your own subplot. Also, where the hell are the explosive rounds? Really??? Ugh....



In conclusion, if you are new to the resident evil franchise and you don‚Äôt care much for the old skool content, you may find value here. As for me, having grown up playing the original RE 1,2,3 etc... I cannot recommend this game to any veteran of the series, especially at this price. You are paying a full price for half a game, and not getting what they promised - A REMAKE.

At 29.99, I'd recommend it but since they cut out the alternate gameplay, I cannot get behind the price.",Not Recommended," February 17, 2019"

RE2 remake is not what RE used to be. The zombies take multiple shots to the head and go down and get back up multiple times. For a RE game where ammo is scarce this is kinda ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Also playing as Sherri is the worst thing I have seen in an RE game. Literally you run away from a fat pedo ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Not my kinda thing but maybe the devs are into that. Compared to RE4, this game looks better but thats about it.

I don't get the hype, it's an ""okay"" game but nothing amazing. So far the ""puzzles"" felt like one fetch quest after another. Zombies needs 10+ shots to the head before they die. No DS4 button icons. This is my first impression of the game for the time I played. Will update the review as I play more..........so far, I'm not impressed.

Update.
Played 3.4hrs on ""standard"" difficulty and it sucks, everything is bullet sponge no matter where you shoot it. Normal zombies needs 10 shots to the head to go down. It feels like it doesn't reward player agency or skills, they give you a set amount of bullets that not enough to kill everything in a game that's not designed with a proper avoidace gameplay. You can't stealth, melee, sholve, hide or dodge your way to victory. It's just very poorly design.

Restarted and Beaten the game on ""assisted"" difficulty and this time it flows much better, zombies take about 3 headshots to take down and generally much better balanced. I wished the higher difficulty didn't went the bullet sponge rout and just add more zombies instead. The general gameplay involve a set of elaborate fetch quest with zombies sprinkled inbetween. Dealing with zombies consist of shoot or run, neither effectively. If you played any other games of this type (dead rising, RE4, RE5, RE6) you'll find RE2 leaves much to be desired. It's just dull and a bit boring with it's predesessor have so much more going on.

Sorry, but this game is highly overrrated.",Not Recommended," January 25, 2019"

Was hopping to get the best RE game of all time, got a good attempt that misses the mark in so many tiny ways. Would really only recomend for fans of the original to get a bit of that nostalga feels and are ok with a game that is more modern game play wise, but isn't as loveable or fun as the original.

Update: I had hoped with the free dlc they might turn me around on my lukewarm feelings on the game... Boy was I sadly disappointed again.

Claire (A) - the first time you see Birkin, you'll get a black screen when you watch the cut-scene! (better skip it next times).
Claire (A) - when unlock the door (heart key) you'll get a black screen plus mouse pointer artifacts! (full restart)
and a couple of places where you can get a bug. these errors in the game will not let you pass the game normally, without saving and restart. whenever you get a bug you need to restart the game completely!

In development for the better part of 4 years, a reimagining of one of the best RE games ever made. So it's a great game, right?

Well, I have no idea. I've spent the better part of 4 hours over the last 2 days trying to troubleshoot their engine's stuttering because they didn't optimize something. With an i5 + rx 580 I can easily get 100+ fps... the problem is it will intermittently drop frames for no discernible reason. Turning down gfx settings gives even better performance (almost 200 fps), but the stuttering is still there. Moving the game to an SSD does nothing. Frame limiting in both the game and through rivatuner do nothing. Updating/rolling back gfx drivers does nothing. Running hardware monitoring shows none of the hardware are behaving unexpectedly. The stuttering isn't even occurring under heavy load, which would make some sense. It regularly occurs when running around in the police station lobby (which is already fully loaded).

Issue is completely reproducible and a bunch of people seem to have it at present, with no obvious connection between hardware/os/drivers. If they patch the stuttering bug I'll update the review. Until then I'd recommend only picking this up through steam so you can get a refund if you get the stuttering bug.

edit: patched some time last week with zero patch notes... stuttering hasn't changed... people are speculating that the system requirements are a lie and the game requires a minimum of 6 threads to prevent stuttering...

it's also worth noting that the A/B scenarios are super ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing lazy and a huge step back from the original... no idea why they ignored how the original game was structured when it was infinitely better",Not Recommended," January 27, 2019"

I've played the original PSX resident evil 2 several times and I got to say I'm very disappointed.

Reason:
- The game mechanic feels clunky and slow
- Pretty short compare to the original
- No jump scare, or intense music to frighten me
- insufficient Ammunition
- Annoying chase activity with MR.X (was fun for awhile but soon became one of those stupid things that wasted so much time for nothing.)
- Puzzle's in this modern age of gaming seems out of place.
- Boss battles felt bad and dull

I really thought this was going to be a great game and I had no issue with them changing the story and design a bit but seriously this felt mediocre. The original was a mixture of a shooter and survival horror which kept me engaged, the least thing they could of done was at least give me plenty of ammunition but make it almost impossible to kill the zombie or bio-weapons. Anyone who've played the original and thinks this remake is a masterpiece is full of shiit.

If you never played the original PSX version I recommend you skip this and play that or play the Wii rail-shooter Dark chronicles which is a better representation of RE-2 then this garbage.",Not Recommended," May 17, 2019"

Worst game since Fallout 4 - just triggering YOU (bad English incoming)

I love Silent Hill games especially 1-3. I played these on the hardest difficulty and sometimes I had no ammo. I love RE 2 and I like the being alone in a mansion and having no contact to the outside in RE 1.

I dont mind hard games. Stalker with Mods is awesome. RTCW can be hard and finished it. Manhunt is basic too.
I dont know why I dont have ammo when games managed the difficulty much better like even SH 1 or System Shock. I just cant get satisfying gun play compared to SH and System Shock 2 were I need to use ammo sparely but I dont feel like they tried to be oldschool by forcing softair weapons on you and a Tyrant / Mr X that doesnt even give sh**t when in a short K.O. state. The later parts give you even more useless bullet-sponges. Running around is also not a thing because they grab you and backtracking for the forces you to choose a decission '' do u kill it or take damage ''. Its no RE1 where the hitboxes are just 20% too big and got reduced in RE2 but I got used to.

I think Fatal Frame aka Project Zero did a great job in choosing a good amount of different photo films and healing so that by backtracking and exploring additional ghosts would haunt you.
I get the feeling RE2 tried to be something between being Old-School, Last of Us, Uncharted and being new so that they forgot about being more basic. A great example is the difference between Max Payne 1 and 2 vs MP 3 where you cant even play 5 minutes until you lose control over your character and cant skill the cutscenes. In Metro 2033 everything was balanced around the enemies until they did the Redux. After that the on the rail levels got much harder and that#s my final conclusion:

. Seeing all these great Zombie encounters with BB-Guns that were not a problem in RE 1 Remake makes me sad because I never struggled in RE1 / 2 / 4 and Silent Hill games but THIS is the first modern game where the fact you could hard lock your save ( having no resources to move on ) and restart the game -> it grinds my gears that this even possible.

8.5/10 because it isnt satisfying and ammo is so scarse so that I had to do the first boss twice and the chasing is so forced compared to clocktower. They just need to be more basic and I could not feel a scary mood.",Not Recommended," January 26, 2019"

Resident Evil (or Biohazard in Japan) is one of the game series that I hold dearest to my heart. I played Resi 4, my first Resi game, when I was in primary school. Since then, I got my hands on all resi games I could manage to find, and got my first game console, NGC, just to play 0 and the remake. I got through the entire gun survivor series, including the baffling gun survivor 2 that is basically a rip-off from Code Veronica. Hell, even when I was reconnecting with a dear old friend who I haven't talked with for years, we talked about the days when she could come over and play Resi together.

So knowing that Capcom would make a Resi 2 remake, I was expectedly exhilarated and preordered the deluxe version on both Steam and PS4. While I enjoyed most of the Leon A campaign and was pleasantly surprised by some smart tweaks here and there, my heart sank only an hour into Leon B. It's...SIGH...basically the same game as Leon A sans the beginning. I was physically disgusted when the game showed me the cutscene of meeting William Birkin G1 that is EXACTLY THE SAME as Leon A. The subsequent parking lot sequence only leaves me colder knowing that I'm going to solve the same puzzles and beat the same enemies. So I shut down the game. Don't make me wrong. This game is beautiful and scary, as a Resi game should be. However, I just can't bear to see the AB sequences being butchered by the developers who don't understand what makes the Resi series so good, at least the Mikami era, is the care that went into designing a special experience for the players",Not Recommended," February 8, 2019"

This game could have been amazing. It has amazing textures and details to everything. It has good scares and atmosphere.
Decent voice acting, and its all nice. Up until you relize that the guns are worthless. A rotting corpse taking 8 handgun bullets or more is just stupid and poor game development. I really liked this game and even though they ruined combat, I'm sill playing the game. But honestly how do you screw up so bad on the combat. So you don't want me to shoot all the zombies only like stun them or run. But I don't get enough ammo to stun so I run. Only problem is that in most situations you want to run there are 2-3 zombies (sometimes more) in a small area. This isnt some open world with lots of room. Its a dark cramp police station ( And the other areas are just as small) but sure I'll juke 3 zombies in a hallway, oh wait I can't. And I dont understand why is it when we get grabbed we can only fight back with a knife or a grenade. Both Leon and Hunk are trained in hand to hand combat and should easily be able to knock a zombie off of them. Ok if they get grabbed from behind or by 2 zombies, its understandable then. But when its just 1 zombie you should be able to knock them down with ease.

The RE2 PC review of game design/play depth.

I was Gifted this game by a Forum User giving copies away so Iets review.

I did however play test & refund it a month earlier, seeing as its back in my Library & unable to re-gift it for Christmas.

The Paid DLC/Deluxe is lackluster & boring, the only upside is the free content dropped if that counts for anything, which it doesn't as the 3 Ghost Survivor Modes reek of no desire to be creative, & I can't help see Ada's & Chris's Missions from the Original missing. The real eyesore however are the Soundtracks & Unlock All for 3& 5$ both which amounts to Lazy Greed, Unlock All should upgrade you to Deluxe/Include with that version, Its a gloried fully completed save file that can be freely added with a Mod on PC, however the option is nice for console but should still be a 5$ Upgrade to Deluxe, Just my Opinion.

Game Design, you would think the Remake would evolve upon the original rather than cheap out only including certain aspects of it, you'll notice quite quickly the lack of inspired enemy variety & design, theres room for improvement due to RE3 so I highly expect the ability for modders to add in Hunters & Giant Spiders backwards into RE2.

I'm certainly not a fan of non-destructible objects or static ones like chairs/tables/doors which MR.X just doesn't break, you clearly interact with a chair to unblock a door but for whatever room don't have the brain power to push a dresser in front of a door like in RE4, & if I recall a licker in the one key room which hop the window does break that table I believe.

Map was designed well enough for the First Run of the game beside lacking the above interactions which many objects could had been used for, I seriously can find a fireaxe or chair to push a zombie with or block doors with shelves :( oh well, however what remains unforgivable is the lazy design choice of Run Swap to the other Character which uses the same keyitems & puzzles like I magically just didn't the first run. Adding Key items just for Leon isn't hard nor is pathing his route to avoid or do the reverse/make use of the puzzles in a different way.

Causing gapping plot holes & odd altered cut-scene encounters or lack of between Claire & Leon its just wrong.

I still way to drop items on the ground like RE0 not in a Box that brings items cheaply to me later ingame what is this easy mode, its the one design from the old games I wanted gone as it was never needed.

Am I the only one Missing the use of Claire's Main Secondary Weapon, AKA Triple Shot Crossbow, Pinning Zombies to the wall would had certainly been useful, sort of like DEAD SPACE HARPOON USEFUL!

So No this is not n Evolution of the Original Game just a simplified lesser port into 3D with fancy graphics or rather just modern, heck RE6 graphics would had been fine for this REmake, not picky about how a game looks just how that make use of the assets.

Worth picking up for 20$ sure, unless you needed something better at the same price, its the last extra you should tack-on when grabbing a few games not something mow down zombies to nab as quickly as possible, same for RE3 20$ MAX.",Not Recommended," December 24, 2019"

Maybe I had too many expectations on this game. I feel more disappointments when I got this game.
I have to admit It's a good idea to use an entire new engine to remake this classic game, and re-creating 3D assets is definitely needed. But the game is way different. On the other words, it's another game with brand new story. There are a lot terrible things in this game -
First, and also the worst thing in this game is OVER THE SHOULDER control only that is the most annoying setting...I hate this mode BLOODY MUCH! At least Capcom should keep the original camera mode there.
Second, The sotry is worse than original RE2. The orginal has 4 sotry lines for 2 protagonists (Leon and Claire). All 4 storylines are clearly different but clues are responsive to each other perfectly, and also come with different monsters. In this Remake game, there are only 2 storylines. If you play other two, they are pretty much the same. And some plots do not make sense as Leon's story and Claire's do not match each other.
Third, it's still about the story. Why the hell are they changing the story? They should make exactly the same as the original RE2 with the better 3D assects, and releastic physic systems. If they want to make a game with the same engine, just make another game.
Fourth, Some facilities and technologies do not make sense in 1998. For example, the U drive (STARS badge drive), Ada's magnegtic gun, and the arm band are not popular in 1998. And remake of the Umbrella bridge facility They are supposed to appear in 2019.
Fifth, The characters are changed. They have different personalities. For example, the original William Burkin looks cool and have cold voices that is one of my favorite things. Even if he did not survive for long, I like this one in oringinal RE2. The new Burkin look like a kid, not cool at all!
Resident Evil franchise has ended since RE4 released. The game has become the action super sci-fi star war. I miss RE2, RE1, RE3, and Veronica, and all classic camera control games. That is almost like interactive movies that I enjoyed a lot!

After playing and beating it when it came out and experiencing the nostalgia (it was wonderful) I still feel like the replay value of this game is ""meh"" at best. A $60 price tag is far too steep, in my opinion, for a game that I'll only play through a couple times max in my entire life. The extras are cool but get old fast. I guess I'm over it.

If you grew up playing Resident Evil 2 like I did then you'll appreciate going through Raccoon City Police Department all over again. It is a masterpiece... but it feels like it'll just sit and collect dust in my steam library for eternity at this point. I guess that's why I don't buy games much anymore. -shoulder shrug-

All I can say it is not true to the original. Yeah the RPD is very accurate to the original and a great visually appealing game, but never have I had an issue with ammo with the original. In the remake it feels like head shots don't make any difference. Knee shots are more effective due to it takes less ammo to slow them down (2-3 shots to the knee) than to kill them (4-6 shots to the head) like what kind of sense does that make? Am I using a damned pellet gun rather than a 9mm I'm told I'm using? There's a fine line between challenging than almost impossible. A lot of other games give you a bit of extra ammo, or a knife/melee attack if you run out of ammo in a boss fight or something as a buffer, but in RE2 remake, its a set amount. When you run out, you're just screwed, you have no melee attacks, you either restart or die. Normal difficultly feels like a harder difficulty, and I don't even want to try a more challenging difficulty when or if I beat it on normal. I really want to love it, it gets my heart rate going like no other game I've played, but to play a game that you cant kill the zombies to beat, I hate it. 2/10 wouldn't recommend,",Not Recommended," January 30, 2019"

Bar none the worst game I've played in a long time. Easily the worst I'm stuck with in my Steam Library as it drags ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in the first part so you can't return it. Enemies are bullet sponges to the point the game isn't fun. Regular enemies shrug off headshots like they didn't even happen. There are other ways to balance the game without that mess. The first boss was so frustrating I just quit. Not hard, just infuriating, he runs off and isn't on screen long enough for your character to focus his aim which takes nine years. So the fight just drags on and on. I'm sorry, I'm not in the business of telling myself lies about a game just to make myself feel better about a purchase. This is a slap in the face to a classic. I wish people would write more critical game reviews. I don't expect a win handed to me, but when I shoot a minor enemy in the head 8-12 times and it doesn't die the programmers did something horrifically wrong. I would love to write a good review for a change, it seems like game mechanics just get worse as time goes on. This is because people have buyer's remorse. You people buy games and spend so much money on them that you feel that if you're honest it's somehow a bad thing. The reality is I think most of the positive comments are coming from either people blinded by nostalgia or that don't want to admit they got burned. Skip this one, I wish I had.
(Edit: I've pushed forward in this game and the addition of Mr. X and the segment with Sherry makes this feel like one of the many generic indie horror games I despise so much. I thought I was getting Resident Evil, not Tattletail or whatever. Calling this a ""remake"" is deceptive marketing.)",Not Recommended," March 22, 2019"

Another Resident Evil with a third person perspective with a camera that is way too close to see what's going on in front of your character most of the time (think Resident Evil 4). The graphics are... Not as great as everyone was saying they are. I play on a Titan X and I can say they are far from exceptional.

I bought this the day it came out in slight excitement. Resident Evil 2 was my all-time favorite, a lot due to sticking to a story without some guy coming out all of the sudden and following you around that you can't kill in the main scenario. As soon as I started I was looking forward to that initial journey to the police station. Soo many memories as a kid from all the different locations and the struggle it was to get there. Well.. They cut all of that out and you're basically just there. Once arriving you'll quickly find that the main interior has extra ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Right here, this I found saddening. How could they just change the layout? It's like changing history! Looking past this, I kept on figuring there is just no way they could ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• this game up. The paths you take are all arranged differently to the point you're going ""wtf, this room was never in the game.."" or ""why is there a third set of stairs here?"" not to mention a third floor that suddenly exists. The elements of the original release just simply don't exist. It's like hearing the original story from someone who knows nothing about it. Like when you meet that person that wants in on your conversation so they make a bunch of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up that never happened. That's like this game.

As if everything else weren't disappointing enough, here comes this 'Mr. X' character that you can't kill. Simply idiotic. He looks stupid as hell not to mention that he just punches your character in a ridiculous looking fashion and you run. Run run run, go about your business while he chases you walking around the whole time.

It's really a pathetic attempt making something that was once one of the greatest games of all time feel like a generic rip off. I really can't say one good thing about this game. Sure, you can walk through doors without that hesitant animation but you're just walking into disappointment at every turn. Ada Wong has suddenly changed into some hard ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• FBI agent. The aiming reticle is annoying as hell (shrinking slowly into a point) and Claire looks absolutely nothing like her original character.

I give this game a 2 out of 10 and at most it should be $30 for a deluxe edition. Just another Capcom failure. Sadly, I have to say that Resident Evil 7 held my interest longer than this piece of crap did. I mean 7 was basically just a rip off of the Evil Dead series along with countless other things with a mold allergin as the cause. Interesting as that could have been, lets put a couple guys made out of ooze and this old redneck guy who can't die in there. Oi, that's a whole different flaw altogether but my point is that it grasped my attention more than this.

I suggest borrowing it from a friend that got cheated out of $60 on some ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• console or just watching a playthrough on YouTube. You're not missing much.",Not Recommended," February 13, 2019"

The Resident Evil franchise is like the Metal Gear games, it has a fanbase full of fanatics, so anyone who says the game is bad is shot down. But this game is bad. And short. Fanboys are too biased to admit that the reason they mostly die in this game isn't because of the difficulty or because it's a great survival game, but because the controls are atrocious. 90% of my deaths were because of the doors. Because the devs thought it would be "" realistic "" to make the character not able to open the doors like any real person or any other video game character. The character will make a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t move that don't look nothing like real to open the door and so the door will first half open and THEN only will it open completly. Meaning if you had an ennemy hot on your tail ( because ennemies never die in this game ) you'll get grabed because you take a full 2 seconds to open a door while running for your life because your character still want to open the doors calmly. Also if you had just opened that door, you can't use it for a good 5 seconds. So if you took a door, realized a zombie was right behind it in a very tight coridor where you can't go past him, and want to turn around, then you're screwed. Because you have to watch your character run into the door for 5 seconds while the door is still in its closing animation before the door can start opening again. And to think the devs touch themselves thinking of how good and realistic they think their game is... And you see this. Your dumbass character running into the door for what feel like forever before the door can open because gasp it wasn't done closing! Even a toddler knows how to open a door that's moving. But your adult character can't.
The other 10% of my deaths were because of the clunky as hell animations. They wanted to go for "" realistic movement "", but anyone can do a sharp turn while running... But not Leon or Claire. Sometimes you'll feel like your character isn't even going where you're telling him to because the "" realistic "" movement make him make some kind of detour to turn.
I'm not writing a bad review because I died in this game. I play really hard games like The Evil Within where on akumu you die 50 times. But at least in TEW it's because the game is hard, not because of the clunky animations or the doors taking forever to open with your character running into it looking dumb as all hell.
And the bosses... My God. Typical RE, it's always the same with them. They put you in a arena stage with a big boss with eyes popping up that you have to shoot. Nothing creative here, or original, no skills or brains needed. I'll take TEW example again, but in TEW when there's a boss, there's a lot to try, lots of strategies. You can use your environement to damage it, traps, many different weapons... In RE you just shoot. With a range of 3 weapons tops. No traps, no puzzle to solve to figure out the best way to kill the boss... You just shoot in the eyes.
If you're a franchise fan, yeah you'll like this game because every RE fan love the games especially if it's a remake of the old games. But if you're not that familiar with the RE games and don't know the franchise, then don't waste your time in this. It's not worth your time, because anyone who loves a REAL good horror game will either be bored to sleep most of the time because it's damn easy, or get frustrated because the only times you die it's because the control are clunky.",Not Recommended," December 16, 2019"

Original RE2 >>> RE2 RemakeÔªø Someone needs to be critical on the remake. Everyone just caught up in the hype. Its a good game but nowhere near what the original was.

1) Why couldn't they go the RE1 remake route....

2) Missing enemies and bosses (some of the most memorable parts)

3) That G crane battle was trash what's the point of saving ammo if it cant kill the boss. along with cheap gimmicks to defeat boss battles were not something I enjoy

4) The DLC I usually could care less however the fact crapcom charged extra for the soundtrack and gave a half as soundtrack for the base game is just lazy
(my first playthrough I didn't know about the DLC so I played the whole game on that bland soundtrack)


5) The environments were too enclosed whoever thought blocking off 75% of the police station at the start doesn't understand classic RE

6)How they changed kendos story to force some emotional moment was boring and irrelevant (I lmao when I saw the giant hole in front of the gun shop like hmm where to go next)

7)Also the way they moved the city environment from the start to the middle of the remake was poorly done all to introduce a new area that was like 3 rooms...

8) The sewers were done okay but the labs were like a bad movie parody and then its over. You then fight the last bosses. Its like no effort was put into the lab

9) Ada's mission with the x-ray gun felt cartoonish all Annette had to do was shoot her...however sherry side mission was absolute cringe

10) The aiming was fine but the reticles were bad why not just use laser sight on all guns or something that's not so blocky or even take it all away

11) Mr X was overrated and underused the fact you couldn't down him for more than a few seconds was pointless why even waste ammo. This is why nemesis encounters were so great in RE3. Do you run or if you choose to fight and spare the ammo you down him you could receive a item and keep him off your back for while felt like true strategy. Not this oh I need to play hide and seek in a safe room and not fire my weapon so god armor x don't hear me pushing book cases together


12) Now people are high Capcom because they gave you free DLC Ghost survivors ""A month after release."" linear Battle style missions with new monsters and a half baked story... ok so here's my question why were these new creatures not in the main game why did we have to wait a whole month for these missions.

Here is the answer because Capcom half Az everything.... RE6 was a mess.. RE7 story and 2nd half was a joke...Revelations 2 was incomplete trash everything crapcom has done with RE after 4 has been seriously flawed...",Not Recommended," February 16, 2019"

While largely competent, this is a technical mess that needs a great deal of ironing out which I don't actually expect to happen. There are massive bugs that will either completely miss you or butcher playing the game properly. (In my case, the game doesn't detect most of my VRAM, so it won't utilize it to make the game look like it should. Potato mode on a GTX 1060 shouldn't be a thing for a few more years.)

But in addition to that, the difficult is dreadfully schizophrenic. On Normal difficulty, it wildly fluctuates between insultingly easy, to sadistic, and when Mr. X shows up, his behavior seems to be tailor-made to arbitrarily lengthen the game, forcing you to do things like backtrack through several rooms to do something as simple as grab an item, all because he teleported off-screen to magically appear in front of you. After you FINALLY got rid of him 2 rooms ago.

Perhaps I simply don't have the patience for it. I've completed Leon's A scenario and kind of don't want to play any more despite having 2 1/2 more to finish.

1606,[REDACTED],"
I would've recommended this game if it's not a RE2 Remake.

Problem 1: Revisionism
The story line gets rekt hard this time. The interaction between Leon and Claire is basically removed from the game,

Problem 2: Enemy-Resource balance
OMFG was resources scarce. I'm playing on ASSISTED mode and by the end of my Claire A I've used up all of my herbs. Problem is this time the enemy is so resilient that will take ~5 headshots from .45 pistol to die. Compared to 5~6 9mm shots in the original. So you're basically screwed if you are playing it the old fashioned way.
But wait, you might say that you can evade them in the original game right? Well bugger you got the point. This game has greatly enhanced the ability for zombies to grab you and having a bite off yer neck. Which means:
A. You chose to kill them all, ends up with 0 bullet and got rekt.
B. You try to evade them and gets bitten into pieces.
C. You managed to strike a balance between engaging and evading and come out with barely enough ammo and medicine.
Either way this game is not that comfortable. It's more like RE7 (Which is complete garbage) than RE2.

Problem 3: You can't tell if a zombie is taking a nap or it's taking dirt nap.
In the original game we have the indicator called blood. This game? Nothing.

Problem 4: Bosses
It's all about knowing when you should fight and when you should just leg it. Again, no clear indication.

Problem 5: Content
The major problem of this remake.
In the original game Scenario A and Scenario B have a lot in common but the scenarios were connected and provided adequate major differences for it to be fun. This game, on the other hand, was too repetitive.

Before I start, I have to say that there is much in this game that I like. It is a great game. Or I'm guessing because my experiense is tainted by all the lies in the game. So let's begin.

My first impression of the game was good. Atmosphare was great and game play was good. And because I loved limited saves on original, ofcourse my choise of difficulty was Hardcore. Lots of puzzles and ammo management. It felt like I was playing a real remake of RE2. But then I started to notice few problems. Zombies did not die. I emptied my shotgun (6 shot) and few pistol rounds on one zombies head and it did not explode. And then one memo said that lickers are blind. But then on few places, they were not and thay found me behind two corners althou I didn't make any sound. Then the tyrant come. In the original game you could shoot the tyrant down. It would always come back, but it stopped following you and left you alone to progress in the game. But tyrian in this remake eats all you ammo and doesn't even slow down. I doesn't make the game scarier, it makes it cheaper.

So summary of all I think is wrong (so far)
-Game lies to you about it's mechanics
-Immortal Zombies
-Tyrant is annoying, immortal and copy of Jack Baker (RE7, even in that, immortal slenderman clones were stupid)
-Hardcore difficulty is a lie
-Sometimes your defensive weapons take a day off and Leon gets eaten having a combatknife, 2 handgranades and 3 flashbangs in his inventory",Not Recommended," January 27, 2019"

* Tyrant ruins any desire to explore via its annoying, unavoidable omnipresence

* Shooting zombies in the head does ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• all. Enjoy wasting up to 8 bullets to eliminate a single zombie that, without fail, will instantly latch onto you should you instead try to slip past it

* Such a dearth of ammunition that you find merely a few bullets IN A ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING GUN STORE. Brilliant!

* Need to abruptly quit and attend to real life responsibilities? Too bad! Save points are relegated to sporadic typewriters! Your choice is to pause the game indefinitely, or -- god help that you need to use your PC -- lose a vague amount of progress (per autosave)

* Unskippable cutscenes! Enjoy watching the same 30s dialogue beat over. And over. And Over. While you discover by trial-and-error whatever inane sequence of keystrokes will move you past this instant fail-state sewer monster encounter.

At some point I just completely checked out and decided playing further wasn't worth the frustration. I don't care what happens to our bowl cut protagonist. I don't give a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about finding the latest McGuffin to unlock door X. I'm tired of manhandling this awkward third-person hero through corridors filled with bullet-sponge zombies and zero mechanics to finesse them. I just...don't care anymore. The more I play, the more I utterly resent this game.

It's important to note that I didn't play the original. Maybe others will have the nostalgia goggles necessary to pretend that this is a good game in 2019. But I personally couldn't even finish it. I'm writing it off as a $60 faux pas, a sunk cost, and moving on to more enjoyable media. Things that are actually fun.

I simply cannot recommend this game. Spend your money elsewhere. Hell, take some of that $60 and buy /, , and . Titles that actually get survival horror (mostly) right.",Not Recommended," February 3, 2019"

going into this i was expecting something along the lines of re4 but i was pretty disappointed. adaptive difficulty punishes you for playing well and makes the enemies into big dumb damage sponges. so the most optimal decision is to just run past all the zombies. if you do use your gun, it will be to kneecap zombies so you can more efficiently run past them.

mr x is more of an obstacle to be cheesed rather than something to be dealt with in an intelligent manner. this feels more like amnesia with guns. you might like it but i didn't.

something else that bothered me is that damage is tied to framerate for some inexplicable reason. high framerate means more damage and low framerate means less.",Not Recommended," January 29, 2019"

Nope.

I'm a huge fan of RE 4 (finished it 5 times or so) and I absolutely loved RE 7. Since this game looked like a mix of both and I liked the timed demo, I decided to try it.

First impression is good, the graphics and ambient are excellent, but about 2-3 hours in, some fire alarm starts and the gameplay completely changes. Zombies are everywhere and even though I had plenty of ammo, I just seem to run out of it all of a sudden.

I never had that problem in RE 4 or RE 7. Yes, ammo is scarce in those games too but at least there was some balance. In this one you just have to predict somehow how many more zombies will there be ahead and instead of killing them, run around to escape. The game is so immersive, why did they have to ruin it like that?

Capcom seems to know that because you can buy a DLC that unlocks some weapons with infinite ammo.

Also the zombies quickly become bullet sponges and stand up 3 or 4 times before dying. There's no sense of satisfaction like when doing a headshot in RE 4. Did the developers really expect us to run around? Then why bother with a so immersive and dark environment?

Bought the deluxe! And man was I expecting a good game! Well, the silliness started from the very beginning. Out of ammo after a couple of shots with NONE in site, but he has ammo for the cut scene. Basically, this game is a huge treasure hunt amidst multiple zombies in very confined space and corridors of the police station, with zombies that dont ever die. So you hunt for ammo to temporarily stun the zombies, aim for the head to use less bullets because every one will get back up and follow you. You do this while you continue to hunt for clues to solve various puzzles. PSSST.... What a MONUMENTAL LET DOWN this game was! For 70 bucks I expected WAAAAAY better than this! Requested a refund!

Even though I'm refunding this, I'll recommend the game for those who don't mind blowing their money. And not recommending for anyone on the fence. I played the game for a bit. I liked it, it's thrilling. The number of game settings you have to choose from is amazing compared to any other title. It feels well designed. But I don't like it enough if I'm only going to get 10 hours out of it for $60. It should be $25 if it's mainly a short story on maps that don't change. Even then that's kind of a hard sell for me.

Apparently the replay value only comes from the desire to achieve shorter and shorter mission completion times. If you're not into that, don't buy this game. If you're truly comfortable with blowing $60 on a game you could beat in a week or two and forget about forever, then definitely buy RE2.

Really disappointing level design. They put you on a prison and ask you to find random objects without any indication where they are or what you need to do to find them. You'll be running left and right not knowing what you are supposed to do. This is a terrible game, if people think this is a GOTF I better just stop gaming for the rest of the year. Resident Evil 7 was way better.

You will get lost on the police departmen, all the hallways look the same, everything is confusing and the zombies will stop being scary but annoying instead.

At the very least it would be nice to have the game explain that the map shows if there are objects in the area to be explored or not (blue means explored red means that there are objects to find), something I only found out by Angry Joes review of the game (oh, by the way, what his intro, it summarizes my inicial complain)

Not everything is bad thought. The second map (after escaping the police department by finding the terrible 3 coins or whatever they call them the game will get better, until it gets terrible again because you will find a grey dude that never leaves you alone, he's no annoying. I only hope you haven't at the that point thrown the controller to the ground with so much force due to frustration that you can't even get to that phase, because I did thrown mine (thankfully it didn't broke)

""Character moves as if in molasses, impossible to toggle run and have it stay on. It doesnt take 10 bullets to the head to kill any thing living or dead.

My guess is the control issues are due to the game being designed for console controllers rather than mouse and keyboard, and the gameplay and cutscene issues being due to trying to deliver scares in lieu of content.""

This game seems designed to frustrate attempts to control the character you are playing. I have never seen so many cutscenes in a little over an hour of gameplay.

Doesn't feel like a resident evil game and this is coming from somebody who has literally completed every game in the series. Relies completely on jumpscares.

Im glad they made it 3rd person but this just doesn't feel like the game I hoped. I also don't like the difficulties. I enjoy a challenge and playing games in the hardest setting but 15+ head shots to kill a zombie? that's not a challange that's just a chore. Also might I add the mass amount of bugs it has.

The cinematic is so boring and looks like it is made for 7years old. I would rather play the game than watch the boring cutscenes.

The gameplay is not smooth, the movement feels like the main character stumbles on everything. And you can't jump. The main issue for me is that the zombies can take 7 bullets to the head before they are knocked down. But they are not dead. They can raise up anytime.

I hate to give this game a negative rating. If I could give it a Nuetral rating, i would.
I never played the original RE2 but I have played RE4, 5, 6 and 7 so maybe this can give some insight to those new to the series.
I love the overall atmosphere of the game but that's about all this has going for it.

-The enemies are just bullet sponges. The worst I ever had it was a zombie who took SEVEN(7) shots in the head to kill and that was on EASY. (I only did easy my first run specifically because people were saying how spongy the enemies are so I thought they wouldnt be on Easy but they were).

-Constantly being chased by Tyrant for a few hours was more annoying than it was scary especially since he is scripted to block your path when available so its just you kiting him around an object so you can run past him. Annoying, not scary.

-Enemy variety is non-existant. You'll mostly be killing Zombies 95% of the time. In my playthrough the only other enemies were about 3 Lickers, 4 Dogs and 4 Ivys. Was that a problem? Not at all but it's weird since the other ""special"" enemies take WAY WAY WAY less bullets than a regular Zombie to kill.

-The game, IMO, was way too short. I understand you're supposed to do a playthrough with each, but, I'm about 2 hours into my 2nd playthrough and it's just a more rushed version of my first playthrough.

Did I enjoy the game? yeah, sure. But if you want this game, I wouldn't spend more than $20 on it since you'll only get maybe about 10 hours out of it if you know what youre doing.",Not Recommended," January 28, 2019"

Not Sure Why This is So Overpriced

So I bought my son a new graphics card for his PC, changed him over to one of the best AMD cards for his rig and we got 2 games free for doing so. We where able to choose 2 of 3 games, either Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry 5 or The Division 2. We chose Devil May Cry 5 because my son wanted it and I chose Resident Evil 2 even though it isn't normally my kind of game, there was no other option really because I/we do not use Uplay...

So after playing this game for 70 minutes (which is obviously not very long at all) here are a few early points from this game. Now the price of this game (¬£40+) completely baffles me if I am being honest, but I don't pay Steams silly prices for games and use keysites only usually, I have never paid Steams prices for any game as of yet (1800+ Games Bought) so for a game to be priced at such a ridiculous cost makes zero sense to me, it would have to be a brand new ""AAA"" graphical masterpiece for me to even consider it, and even then I would wait for keysites to have it cheaper.
So what do I think of this game so far...... Well I played Resident Evil 2 back in the day and it was a good game but it was nothing special, they are all pretty much the same. I quite liked Resident Evil 7 and I would say that is the best I have played from this series to date. I am not a big ""horror"" fan and if I am being honest I find this genre quite boring, for me to be impressed the game must be a graphical masterpiece and although this game is quite nicely designed, it is far from amazing. With that being said this has been well remastered and plays as it should, but it is nothing special and I can't see where the silly valuation has come from if I am being honest. Would I buy this game normally? No certainly not, do I recommend this game from the short playthrough I have had? Not for the price that the game is listed on Steam no.
If you are a Resident Evil fan or a horror fan then maybe paying ¬£40+ for this game is understandable I guess, if you are neither of the above but still want the game... Just wait a few weeks and it will be dirt cheap on geetooaa or another of the great digital download sites.
The game runs flawlessley on my PC maxed out using 1440p @ 165hertz, never dipping below 100fps. (I use 2 x 1080ti Xtreme cards), so there are no issues with the game performance. I don't usually review a game after just 70 minutes, but in this case I won't be returning to this game again so this is just a review before I uninstall Resident Evil 2 and it sits in my library for the longevity of my account.

If you dont own a controller, your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed. 30 minutes trying to get past the initial setup screen before I gave up and requested a refund. No requirement to have one a controller is mentioned, and no one seems to have a definitive answer to how to get round it, especially steam or the developers (and nothing I've found from other users has worked).

I only played the game for 38 minutes so take this review with a grain of salt. I have a few pet peeves which I find as a real turn-off and this game hit all of them all in them very beginning which is why I decided to refund it so fast. I am sure it is a fine game but it is not my cup of tea.

#1 I do not like games that throw me to the dogs in the very beginning. I prefer to be eased into the game to allow me time to figure out the various keys to use. In this game I spent most of my time being eaten alive in the first 38 minutes and I played the beginning twice. I really did not get to play it much since the game was being driven by cinematic scenes which just took me from place to place to be eaten. It would have been nice if they had taught me how to shoot, I figured that one out myself, reload ammo, did not figure that one out, so I was just dinner for the zombies in the game. Where is the police station? I have no clue. I wasn't alive long enough to figure out how to find it.

#2 I do not like dark screens. This is relatively new as one of my pet peeves but my eyes are getting tired in my old age and they dislike dark screens. I realize that the dawn will come but when you start me off with a dark screen it just adds fuel to the fire.

#3 I dislike playing 3rd person or looking at myself from the outside. 3rd person has it uses and I do make use of it occasionally but on the whole it is normally one more nail on the coffin.

When you put these 3 pet peeves together all at once, it is time for a refund.",Not Recommended," June 27, 2019"

What a waste of a game. I get that it's a 2019 revamp of an older game but you'd think the devs would at least figure out how to update it with a windowed mode. It's 20freaking19 guys, we use dual screens. If you're used to playing more moderns games that will give you some sort of onscreen indicator of which direction to go? This is not your game.

How did this happen... The demo was awesome. I have played and beaten this game several times on the PS1 and PS3. This garbage is unbelievable. Anytime you have to move under duress the game gets all jittery and control stops working. Zombies magnetize across the room to you, when you are nowhere near them. The game claims an autosave, but they are the same as the typewriters or worse. Load times on an 8700k and 1080 ti are way too long, especially when constant restarts are needed from the magnet zombies. Ammo is too precious to waste every shot is needed for the final boss. I played, and loved, this game with the notorious ""tank"" controls so it seems easy to think standard wasd keyboard controls would be miles better, but somehow we get this. A lazy cash grab. Another lazy cash grab I mean. Truly too bad. Very disappointing. Think I am being too harsh - This game came out at $60 a few months ago and now it is on sale.

Once again corporate greed has ruined a valuable franchise. The game is good... except there is an automatic timer on your crosshairs every time you want to shoot. When you first aim your gun you get these huge crosshairs, and if you shoot like this you will miss 90% of the time. You have to wait until the timer counts down until your guns shoot where you aim. After a few hours of the game, this becomes absolutely infuriating. The zombies have concrete heads. Your knife, which used to get you by in the original game if you got low on ammo, snaps like a twig if you try to use it? Why all the added control difficulty? DLC PEOPLE! How convenient you can buy all the unlocks in the game for 5 dollars.....on top of the full game price.. I wish I could punch the Capcom executives in the face one by one.

The game falls short as a remake considering it does not include all parts that made the original Re2 great.
1 - It's missing enmies,
2 - No zapping
3- no story continuity making the 2nd run repetative and just a repeat of the first
4 - it kills the whole idea of survival horror and just makes it a generic shooter with parts of the original game as a facade to get old fans hyped.

I played the old game and it felt fresh and even the later remake of the 1st game felt fresh and even added stuff but this game falls short and doing the 2nd run is more tedious requirment than actually something to look forward too when playing the game.

I can't even understand why people call this game hard it's actually not. Even Mr X is more annoying than scary and seems to even have teleport power which makes him annoying to immerse into the main area.

I like a lot of the gameplay but the annoying parts are too many. This is a console port & has the typical bugs of porting. The menu controls are just one. You have to use arrow keys & space bar to make choices. The mouse is very limited. FOV (field of view) adjustment does not help. The focus is too close. Cant see past the character taking up much of the screen. That being said, I am playing on three 24 inch wide screen monitors with a resolution of 5760x1200 & I still have trouble seeing past the character. I watched gameplay on you tube with one screen & can see that one screen is better. When the puzzle screen comes up i cant see all the puzzle. You cant choose when to use your flash light. The game chooses for you. You cant punch, push, melee or kick the bad guys. LAME! With the FOV broken the alligator scene took 7 times to complete. What's with the female characters in games today being arrogant & denigrating? Those are not attractive qualities in women or anybody! & they wont let you shoot her >:) I played on one monitor & the FOV was better. Shame these new games dont consider mutli monitors. I can play Max Payne 1 & 2, Star Wars Outcast & Academy, Vietcong, etc. the list goes on & on, with 3 monitors in 5760x1200 Res. No excuse for new games! If you have a monitor with ""Light Bleeding"", the brightness adjust wont help in the dark areas. Thats not a fault of the game, just pointing it out. Graphics & sound are amazing. Really like the atmosphere. UPDATE- I got the FOV fixed from a German Youtuber. Now i can play the game. Gonna keep the thumbs down because the Dev's lied saying it could not be done. Leave it to modder's to fix peoples games. I just wish I had time to learn what these ""Magnificent Modder's"" know.
""Update"". The Dev's ruined the widescreen fix! The latest update blocked the fix. I can no longer play the game. Good thing I kept the thumbs down. Why would they block a fix? Cap com SUCKS!!!
Update. With all the error's, freezes & crashes to desktop it is difficult to know what is gameplay or bug's. The basement boss battle had the guy stuck in the ceiling & I waited for him to drop & he never did. I left the game on for 20 minutes & he never dropped. It took 7 tries & a few restarts & he finally dropped & the game proceeded. The little girl scene running from the bad man took 6 tries before the final door would go to cut scene escape & the game could proceed. Bug;s galore! So glad I go this for free. Finishing the game just to see how crappy the devs are in making this crap game. Most of my followers have opted out in even trying this game. So i saved them headaches.
UPDATE: December 2019, finally there are ""Mod's"" & ""Trainer's"" to fix all the crap like ultra-wide, FOV, 1st person view, manual flash light. Finally the game can actually be played. Shame on you DEVS.",Not Recommended," January 28, 2019"
1689,evil#W40K,"
ok i know some will hate me for this but i have to jump of the hype train and tell the people the bad sides ....

two things befor i do that

first i have waited for this as long as you im surely one of the biggest re2 fans from the past

second if you buy the game go to this site ""https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Resident_Evil_2_(2019)"" (without cvotes) many of you already know it for sure apply the vignette fix to save your eyes
cap the frame to 60 fps and enable v-sync (capping and v-sync in the ingame options) or you will have some kind of horizontal rubberbanding when moving the camera fast left right
also disable screenspace reflections they look like t1000 is everywhere

why capcom has waited so long for this is beyond me the community was screaming for it instead capcom was throwing one bad game after another at us but ok now its here and ofcs it has flaws and here they are

the b scenario:

maybe im wrong but it feels not like the b scenario from the past it feels like there is missing a lot
not much difference to the a scenario im not sure but i think if i could refund it i would i have only hopes for mods ...........

the zombies:

on one hand i love them because they feel real sometimes fast sometimes slow sometimes argile sometimes kind of everything
but i had zombies i shot 5 times in the head ""5times"" and they still where coming up again
sry but thats to much ofc they could not make them onehits that is clear to me but this just gets annoying after playing 3 scenarios now i say they are to hard to kill sometimes
its not about (it to hard for me or someone) its just not realistic how much dmg they can absorb somtimes
i had a zombie eating 3 acid granades in da face and then still coming back needed another shot with pistol to the head i mean come on thats a joke they are all like mini tyrants exept for that single headshot ones wich come up every 30 minutes xD ik i overdo it a bit here but you will see what i mean this leads to the next thing

the knife:

you can prevent the zombies from getting up again and save ammo at the same time by using your knife an now it comes
some may wont believe it but watch gameplays im not lying they have again the same knife slash spamming animation they have for all of the previous re games im not kidding
when you do your firt knife attack you instant feel like you where in the 1990s and not in a good way
knife durability? really? come on capcom give away this s... pls we have 2019 now
some real good knife attack anitmations with a final stab to the head and the knife has to be always there as standart equipment point

the inventory:

yeah its true now you can upgrade it but still it feels so unrealistic so unnecessary i mean what would you do in such a secenario where you know you have to pack a lot of stuff? right you would grab a backpack or a big gunpouch wich surely can be found in a police station but ok thats one of the things you can overlook while im thinking hey we have 2019 now its time to let some things behind me but not capcom they always had problems to say goodby to there old game mechanics its like they never came out of the 90¬¥s

the movement:

omg the movement controlling leon feels like you bring a drunk friend to his home at very slow pace the ""sprint"" speed its more ""jogging"" for me at least feels to slow and i think they only made it so slow so the game feel longer and because of that it FEELS LONGER in a bad way

the next thig some may take as spoiler so be warned

tyrant:

mr big bad ................. that guy when he first shows up its really tense there is this big guy you cant really stop ofc you can shoot him till he falls an his knees but he will not die he will come up again an follow you over and over
at first like i said its tense but after a few minutes it just gets annoying and isnt tense then anymore just annoying and feels like its only there to push the gametime even more for no reasons btw you will face this enemy wont die thing with another enemy type later in the game very funny :(

the save stutter/freeze:

the game in some areas saves relatively often automaticlly wich is good i like auto save funtions
saving manually breaks the immersion and sometimes you just forget it and have to do things twice
but re2 has the problem that it can stutter or even freeze very bad when its saving and loading the next event or area even on a ssd
you can really tell only by the stutter/freeze and ofc the circle symbol in the left top corner xD ""oh something big will happen now"" that ruins the atmosphere and immersion and is just annoying

a few final words:

i love resident evil i mean the whole series but we all know it has many bad games in there but the original re2 from the 90s will always be in my heart thats for sure as one of the best games of all times
the remake well the graphics specially later after the police station are extremly good not much details but what is there looks amazing specially the lighting and shadows in some areas (its very importend to adjust the brightness correctly more then in any other game i had befor keep that in mind)
but as you all know graphics are not everything its nice to have them but if a game is good or not depends on other things

my conclusion:

its a ok game (but not as good as some gaming magazines tell) not a fantastic one like ""omg i cant wait to play the game again"" specially when you look at all the other re games nothing but the graphics and animations has improved
i think it would be better as fps game like re7 that at least had brought some new wind into the thing (i hope fps mode comes later from capcom or modders) mod support anyways would be a great idea but that counts for every game out there
capcom always was afraid or to lazy to go new ways and you can feel that even now in 2019 and thats a sad thing after all these years they are still afraid of crossing borders and stick to to many of there old mechanics at least the re engine is an awsome thing thats for sure i give you that capcom
but it is still byond me how peeple who developed games like ""operation racoon city"" where able to do that but ok thats another story

i give a thumbs down to warn everyone if you really think you will get something new or extremly good here you will be disappointed
if you think very clear about what you have here without jumping on the hype train its just a ok game but not more
in my opinon this could be much more but yeah if you know capcom you know what you get"" the same s... all over again""

thats it bb

edit: bit of a spoiler for some peeps be warned all re fans can read on

i have unlocked and played the 4th survivor (hunk) and i have to say if the whole game i mean every scenario would be like this then i could at least say its a great zombie horror survival shooter game with stunning graphics but as it stands now its like i said a ok horror surv game with a very cool challenge mode that is sadly to short xD

i hope this will change with some modders out there maybe capcom does something we will see what the future brings for now i feel that the a and b scenarios are kind of boring and to repetitive specially when you have played the original
i have to be honest with one thing playing as ada and sherry was a funny and good idea i give you that too capcom but again both of these ada ada/shery scenario where to short to take them as serious new things

i see re2r as some kind of a very advanced beta test for following re games and capcom i give you the very good advice learn to let go old mechanics that is your absolute biggest problem
try to be more brave with trying out new things i mean you did it in re7 and then you jumped back to old stuff again as all the years befor why? idk i bet you dont even know why
another advice give every next game 3rd and first person view by only doing that you have 2 games in one at the same time a thing every game should have these days ;-) like coop mode

If you like normal zombies which get killed from normal headshot or two - skip this game. If you like horror game - skip this one.

What you can get here is:
- great visuals
- proper voice acting instead of what was in original resident evil 1-3 games

Underwhelming ,thats what i can say about the game. is not terrible , but the gameplay its just obnoxious ,is not a scary game or a action game like the last games

the main issue i have with the gameplay :
-tedious puzzles ,they are not hard to do ,but there is way too many of them and at the end of the game half of your experience its just solving this dumb puzzles ,which is not fun and doesnt add a replay value to the game ,quite the opposite ,you just dont want to play again and solve the same puzzles over and over again.

-zombies random reaction to your shooting. sometimes you can shoot 10 bulets to their head with a smg and they will not react at all and they will bite you like you did nothing to them... this make them feel like bullet sponge and this get worst when you are playing the 4th survivor mini game. they have this weird delay and you will notice it more when you throw a granade to them ,they dont explode... they just fall slowly like their soul left their body.

this issue is worst in claire scenario ,because her arsenal barely do any damage , except for the 9mm and the granade launcher ,the rest of her weapons are too weak ,dont bother.

talking about the zombies, when they bite you ,they block the entire screen , so once you get up you are not sure where your character is looking ,because when the zombie is biting you ,the camera also follow the movement of the zombie ,which means that you end up staring at a wall and basically you are in a death trap , this is worst if you are dealing with 2-3 zombies at the same time.

also the animation take too long , what is the point of seeing your character struggling ? if your character cant fight back anyway, so make the biting animation shorter, just bite me and let me move. it looks nice the first time ,but after a while it gets old really quick and annoying.

i dont understand why your character cant push the zombies ,but they can put a granade into the zombie mouth like a action hero. this get dumber when you are playing the 4th survivor mini game and hunk cant even kick the zombie from his feet and instead just scream in pain and the animation take too long

also scripted bosses ,is weird ,this game is screaming for a push /dodge button or at least some kind of QTE , because there is some scripted moment that feel so out of place and you dont know at first that you cant kill them , you have to go somewhere and active some kind of trap ,until you realize that, you wasted a bunch of bullets for nothing ,also cheap instant kill attacks are the worst , because you dont have too much space to escape and it would be nice to have some kind of button that allow you to dodge them in some way.

and for last... the story ...its just underwhelming. Claire and leon scenario are not too diferent from each other and in some cutscenes they just swap dialogues. what leon said in his scenario A , claire will say the same thing in her scenario B. there is a few interesting scenes ,but overall the story was weak and make you go ""That it ? ""

sorry but resident evil 6 was better than this ,at least the game was playable even with their QTE mess. but this game its just a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to navigate and overall there is nothing fun or scary to it.",Not Recommended," January 29, 2019"

I feel like ""overwhelmingly positive"" is not fair towards some other games and is only because of the nostalgia train some people seem to ride on.

The game is a remake for 60‚Ç¨. That alone would give other games a hate train never seen before.
It reuses A LOT of textures and models from other RE games. It looks like RE5 in better resolution.
The game is only about 5-7 hours long, and only beause a chasing god monster takes 1-2 hours from you as you constantly have to run away from your objective.

The game for 30‚Ç¨? Sure, go for it.

I have always enjoyed EXPLORING locations and things in old good Resident Evil. You know, reading ""It's too dark outside to go out"" when touching a window. Or ""Portrait of odd looking woman"" when checking some picture. Damn, even ""Helmet is etched on this key"". Now, in this remake, where has all of this gone?! Have current developers EVER played true Resident Evil themselves, ever? How hard it was to add such short textual descriptions to key items in the game? Or they would have run out of budget? In this remake I am approaching the statue in the main hall which is definitely some part of a puzzle with 3 medallions in it. I expect it to show some brief mysterious text which would give me some clues. Does it? Hell no. It simply opens my inventory. What the f*ck?
WHEN will Capcom understand that great visuals is not enough, and we love RE series NOT for its visuals? I really regret buying this game as developers have not respected me enough as a fan customer.
Also, how hard it was to add ability of changing a camera view to more RE-like one? Instead of forcing all buyers to a new, very unconvenient, mode.
Absence of VR is another big mistake of Capcom.

+for excellent graphics
+for original soundrack, beeps and bleeps in Deluxe edition

The most BS Zombies I have ever fought, no Capcom a standard Zombie shouldn't be able to walk towards me after three gun shots to the head with out flinching. I keep thinking I can do the same things as in RE4 like kick a door down and knock the enemies back, but no. It still feel like an old school game just with a new paint job.

I am so sick of Zombies in video games and I'm just board. I'm just running around a dark building with people who won't shut up, not exactly scary and Capcom's corny story telling is making it impossible for me to take anything seriously. It just the kind of horror story where you keep talking to the screen to just do _____ and problem solved.
(I know they cant do this in this game, but please game developers stop making door that I know I could just shoot the lock and not find the stupid key)

The game has literally been butchered beyond belief. A horrible remake, the original RE 2 is the greatest ever survival horror game but his remake is terrible beyond belief. I have to congratulate C*apcom for making a cheap and crappy remake of a classic, destroying what was good about it before and then asking 45 to 53 pounds of a persons hard earned cash for it. Worse remake ever.

Cons (where do I start?)
Ugly looking graphics and bad animations even on high/very high settings
Bad micro stuttering
Terrible optimization
Awful controls
Enemies are literal bullet sponges.
Cringe worthy voice acting.
And terrible design choices.


Pros.
Seems to be a lot of content but it has too be unlocked by playing through it. The thing is the game is so bad, on a technical and design and gameplay front that you will not want to bother opening it all up.

RE2rm manages to do almost everything right and is so painfully close to a masterpiece.

However this game is absolutely ruined by the attrocious ballance they gave it. Ammo is extremely scarce, which is only made worse by zombies taking upwards of 15 HEADSHOTS to kill. Even playing by the games rules of ""you're meant to down them not kill them"" can still take upwards of 9 direct headshots to down. Bare in mind you only get ammo in groups of say, 3-5 rounds. This aweful ballance is riddled throughout the entire game and makes every single encounter a miserable experience. Slashing zombies with a knife simply does not work, as the second a zombie is within 4 feet of you, you automatically take damage, or waste a grenade / knife. So it's impossible to traverse an area if you run below 5 ammo. Realistically, if you ever run out of ammo completely you may as well start the whole game over, as I've been forced to do 3 times now due to the complete lack of ammo in the game.

The worst part of all of this is how amazing everything else is. The voice acting, atmosphere, sense of horror, level design art... everything is truely amazing, only to be completely undermined by how unwilling the combat makes me want to even bother.",Not Recommended," January 28, 2019"

This game is short. It took me 21 hours to finish and I'm a slow gamer. It feels a little unbalanced.
Then, after finishing in 21 hours, I see you can play a second run through with Claire. This sounds good at first but when you actually do it, it's just a repeat of the same levels with a different character in a different sequence. Not fun to me.
This game is a total rip off for $60. Should have been half that for the short/limited game play and content.
I didn't even go into the tyrant dude. Should I say artificial manipulation?

Why did I bother barricading the windows if the designers just hardcoded a bunch of zombies in the same places again? And having zombies' survive dozen bullets in the head, really?

Now I've seen a few inflated reviews in my time. But the ones around Resident Evil 2 are something else.

Make no mistake - this is a Playstation 1 game with visuals from ca. 2015. Not sure if I can say that disparagingly enough. The game is _not_ scary. It is still clunky. It is still on rails. The survival part is dependent on getting lucky on how the brainless (pun intended) AI places the zombies in the hallway. And the visuals, well, they're decent but they definitely are not among the best you'll see this year.

Capcom sells this game at an inflated rate in many regions outside of the EU and NA.

They aren't the only company doing this, but in comparison to a studio like Bandai, Capcom is far worse.

Honestly most of this game is fantastic, however a big part of it that ruins a good few hours of gameplay (those few hours seem to stretch forever because I am not enjoying them) is Mr. X. Without getting too spoiler heavy, it makes this game a run and hide simulator. I love the way most RE games incorporate knowing when to run versus when to fight, however the Mr. X encounter aint it. It honestly is more annoying than challenging. At one point I literally just quit out of the game after trying to explore an area three times before being able to finish with the area. Every time I would go back to the area Mr. X would just show up again just to make me run a loop back to the same area so I could finish exploring. If they would have just tweaked the ""chase"" mechanics Mr. X uses this game would be almost flawless, but as is I feel like you spend more time running from Mr. X during a key segment of the game than you do actually playing the game.",Not Recommended, May 27

Overall i don't think this game was necessary and i don't find it particularly good either, this project was an easy way for Capcom to make money in the laziest way, plus the fact that they split them to make twice the money is a big insult to the actual fans, specially considering what the other game provides in terms of content.",Not Recommended, April 6

2. even we run mode it still slow and can't dodge or roll if zombie catch you and you don't have knife or flash then you take bite.
3. even we low on ammo but we force to fight boss so you need save many slot so can reload and save bullet.
4. Mr.X really annoying.

However, I do not like what they did with the second half/B scenario, which was Leon's story in my case. It makes you do much of the same exact stuff that you already did in the A scenario. It is 85% recycled content. The two scenarios are not even connected. You have to find the same keycard to unlock the same weapons locker that should already be unlocked. You have to solve the same puzzles. It makes no sense. Why even have A/B scenario's? Why wouldn't you just start a fresh campaign instead?

This review was rewritten and edited on 3-29-2020.

I originally gave this game a very favorable review. After completing both Leon and Claire's 1st and 2nd runs, I am rewriting my review to reflect my new and more thorough evaluation of the game. This is a good game, if you're a fan of Resident Evil. However it has some serious problems. To start, there's some problems with the weapon wheel not working when I equip certain weapons. I don't know if this is a design choice, or if it's a bug. Either way, it's frustrating and silly. I know it's a small problem to complain about, however it occurs enough during my play-through's that it leaves a bad taste in my mouth for the entire play session every-time it occurs.
For years I have been a huge Resident Evil 2 fan, as well as a fan of the first game. This only feels like those games in terms of it's theme and environment. The game-play is completely different. The biggest problem that I have with this game is the cheesy enemy AI. I hate how the zombies lunge forward. Sometimes they do it over a longer distance than others. Sometimes they turn on a dime and bite you before you can run past them. This is such an annoying feature of this game that it's my single biggest gripe with it, and it's the main reason that I won't be playing much more of it after completing the main portion of the game. This problem clashes with other design choices in the game, such as limited ammo and healing items. It feels like the designers didn't know if they wanted a survival-horror game or an action game. If you want me (the player) to kill every enemy that I meet without running past it, then don't give me limited ammo and healing items. If you would rather I (the player) attempt to maneuver my way past the enemies, then don't give them the ability to move so fast. It's clashes in design like these, that pull me out of the experience every-time.
The zombies in this game take multiple shots to the head. It baffles me. Sometimes you can shoot a zombie with a 9mm round and it's head completely explodes. Other times, it can take upwards of 10 rounds to the head, and still remain active. Why do I even have to aim if it's chance based? What is the point of a precision aiming system, with narrowing cross-hairs if ultimately the damage that I do against my most common enemy is left up to chance? It seems that this was added after the decision to remove the static camera and pre-rendered backgrounds. It made sense in the old Resident Evil games that you had to shoot a common zombie multiple times to kill it, because the aiming wasn't precise. In the event that you had a shotgun, you could just aim upwards and get a head shot most of the time, if they were close enough. This made sense for that game. It makes no sense whatsoever for this game.
I don't want to aim, and have to aim so precisely, only for my shots to be left up to chance in the end, even when I score a direct hit right between the eyes. It feels frustrating and silly to play a game that has been designed this way. It's almost like the designers created the game with the static camera and pre-rendered backgrounds in mind, and then changed it at the last minute, realized that the game would be too easy with one kill head shots in it, and then put a band-aid on the problem in the form of an RNG system for head shots and critical hits.
In the end, the game is good, if you like Resident Evil, but it's more frustrating to play than terrifying or fun. After completing the main game, and experiencing the story, the nostalgia has worn off, and what I'm left with is a game in which the mechanics don't match it's control scheme or theme. If I weren't a Resident Evil fan, I would seriously not like this game. These design choices make me not want to spend money on Resident Evil 3, especially after playing the demo and seeing the same problems in that game. The game is held up by nostalgia, it's legacy, and the story. As a game, and only a game, it's just not for me. If it weren't called Resident Evil, I would have immediately written a bad review for this game, deleted it, and never played it again. However, because it is Resident Evil, and I remember it fondly, I can deal with it.",Not Recommended, January 12

I wanted to like this game. But I just cant recommend roaming in the same boring hall ways, back tracking my steps with no ammo left to shoot any of these zombies. Although the game is very well optimized and runs very smooth on balanced preset.",Not Recommended, January 5

o jogo parece perfeito at√© voc√™ concluir a primeira campanha...
mas a frustra√ß√£o bate na segunda campanha quando a historia parece correr muito mais rapido do que deveria, a narrativa tamb√©m deveria ser paralela √† primeira parte mas voc√™ √© for√ßado a fazer os mesmos puzzles da primeira campanha, enfrentando os mesmos chefes. dava pra ter sido diferente levando em conta a tecnologia que temos hoje.
joguei com o leon primeiro, ao zerar ele te da um save que diz ser parte 2 igual no original mas acabou que deu nessa experiencia zoada que mencionei acima, nesse parte 2 com a claire parei de jogar, n√£o fazia sentido continuar...

the game seems perfect unti you finish the first campaing...
but the frustration begins in the second campaing when in a script that seems to run much faster than it should, it was suposed to be a paralel tale from the first campaing but you get forced to do the same puzzles and fight the same bosses... it just could be done better taking in consideration the level of technology that we have in this generation.

***Minor spoilers, no plot lines given out but lots of deep gameplay explained**

Here's my review....It's really mixed. On one hand it is great in so many ways. I love having the boss battles. I love the creepy feel everything has. I also LOVE the use of dark and light. What do I not like? Mr. x.....He is very difficult to not encounter because of the way the game is laid out. You go down a path and see 2 zombies? Sorry! Can't go that way without back tracking....again....I hate planning a route only to find out it's blocked. You can't get to the door you want to go to because theirs too many zombies. It was pretty fun at first. I had a lot of fun with all the puzzles. If you can tolerate having to back track and re track again and again because of RNG of where zombies are now. Go for it. For me I can't deal with Mr. X. He just limits you WAY to much for the way the game is. I was having fun with it till I found a mechanic that just TOTALLY made the game change how it is played. His learning curve, while not steep takes a lot of time. I spend 50+ hours a week working. I don't want a game that artificially increases play time with a mechanic that makes you backtrack so much.",Not Recommended," December 4, 2019"

Optimization problems. I played the Leon mission whit no problem. Clairs mission was a FPS mess: FPS down to 1. Inmerse destroyer. So the half of the game is unplayable. I enjoyed it when everything was ok, but I payed for a whole game, not the half of it.

I do this review after trying to fix the game for several weeks. By know I think I passed more time trying to fix it than actually playing it.
Im really frustrated.


Problemas de optimizacion. Pude jugar la mision de Leon bien, la parte de Claire tiene FPS drops que llegan hasta los 5. La mitad del juego, injugable. Lo disfrut√© mientras dur√≥, pero pagu√© por un juego completo, no la mitad de uno.

This game is a okay game to most people I assume. However, for a player who have played original RE2 like me, I am sad that a lot of classic contents has been cut or changed for some reasons. And some of them has changed the story continuity, especially RE6 (the real fans should know what I am talking about). I would rather recommend the original RE2 (if you can tolerate the graphic and control).",Not Recommended," November 29, 2019"

An excellent game, a great remaking. You shall play it whether having played the 1998 version or not.

(Update) Although it's a great game, my Rx 580 usually shut down (from 5 mins to 2 hrs randomly) and I must restart the PC. If Capcom or AMD release the patch, I will recommend the game, but now I must give it a negative review.",Not Recommended," February 2, 2019"

This game is like fun but it's story sucks ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and the ""difficulty"" of the game is presented in the lack of ammo they give you. The game desperately relies on puzzles and lack of supplies to stretch out its length. Although there is a lot of value in replaying the story it's obviously a remade version of a game from the 90s. This game looks and feels amazing but Resident Evil 2 is a script full of cringe and the ""difficulty"" is artificial and when you fail in this game you have to watch zombies bite you for 10 minutes before they ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing kill you. I don't care to see my character get ripped to shreds each time they die, not fun at all.",Not Recommended," January 28, 2019"

Very disappointed in this initally. The game looks amazing and has been recieving lots of priase, however, there is a massive issue with the brightness setting on the PC version. I have attempted to contact Capcom about this issue but I have recieved no response. I really want to love this game, but I cannot if I can't even play it due to broken brightness settings. I have attempted to find my own solutions to the issue but have found no results. Only others that have had the same issue. Some stated they found a solution but upon trying it myself, many of them did not work. Buyer Beware.",Not Recommended," January 28, 2019"

Finally passed this classic masterpiece which kept me waiting for so long time. Actually, this remake RE2 could be the most tough challenge of the whole RE franchise, the difficulty is so horrible and the feeling it brought to me was like the one brought that Goddamn Hardcore ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing game Evil Within 1. There is a rumor that Shinji Mikami had participated in the making of the remake RE2, that was a tragedy to me, because, as far as I'm concerned, the biggest mistake of Remake RE2 was its difficulty, they really didn't need to make the game so damn hard. However, the Remake RE2 is still a superb masterpiece to me even if its difficulty makes me annoyed. So I still choose to recommend this game. Before this comment comes to an end, I have to warn those who played the old RE game before, the Remake RE2 is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing hard, don't expect your experience from the previous RE game can save you, if you really wanna play it well, better go play some hardcore game such as Evil Within or Dark Soul, or you joystick or keyboard may have to suffer from you desperate anger.

Have to add this, my gaming skill is not very tough but it's also not bad, the normal or standard difficulty of many kinds of game is not a big deal for me, however, the standard difficulty of RE2 Remake is not a standard difficulty. Compared with other kinds of game, the standard difficulty of RE2 Remake is actually a hard or extreme difficulty, the so-called assisted difficulty is the real normal difficulty. Don't get fooled by the title of the standard difficulty,it's not.

But you don't have to feel ashamed for playing the so-called assisted difficulty, because the creatures from Resident Evil's background is not that tough and hard, the real threat is the contamination from the virus, which can turn a big city into a living hell in no time, not those creatures, the creatures that are derived from the virus is not so hard to deal with. In those CG movies, a licker can be killed by several shot from an assault rife(what's hard is whether you can aim at a licker....) Therefore, the assisted difficulty from RE2 Remake is the real normal difficulty. Just keep that in mind.

Before the stupid update issued recently, I recommended this game, but now I decided to change because the Capcom bastard got prejudice against the PC players this time. I played the standard difficulty recently and I found that the enemies would become tough at the very beginning. I know this game has adaptive difficulty but this had never happened before. Before the update, the adaptive difficulty system would jump to rank 8 when I was about to finish the game. However, after this stupid update, the adaptive difficulty jumps so fast and it can reach rank 8 at the very beginning of the game. What the hell is wrong with you Capcom ? Well, complaint is over. I will never change to recommend until you Capcom fixes this problem or you completely shut down this stupid adaptive system.",Not Recommended," January 27, 2019"
